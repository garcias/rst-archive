Male and female adults from 59-89 years of age (average age = 74.8 yrs) completed a test after being told either \"it is widely assumed that intellectual performance declines with age, so the purpose of this study is to see whether old people do perform\" (stereotype threat) or \"to see how people differ in their responses on different tasks\" (control). After completing the text, participants indicated how anxious they had felt while taking the test and the positivity of their experiences with young people. Results showed that elderly individuals with more positive experiences with young people were unaffected by the stereotype threat manipulation in their performance on the test. In contrast, elderly individuals with negative experiences with young people performed worse on the test in the stereotype threat than in the control condition. Only individuals with negative experiences showed higher anxiety under stereotype threat, and the higher levels of anxiety appeared to account for the poorer test performance under stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "Three experiments examined the effects of exposure to sexism on women's task performance, self-esteem, and sense of belonging in an academic setting. In Experiment 1, female undergraduates who were about to participate in a study were told by another female student who supposedly was completing the study (actually, she was a confederate of the experimenter) either that the male experimenter was sexist (threat) or no mention was made of the experimenter's attitudes towards women (control). Subsequently, the experimenter then either provided negative or positive feedback regarding students performance on a set of \"practice problems\" that were supposedly similar to ones they would have to answer after receiving a brief tutorial. After receiving the tutorial, students completed items similar to those used in the analytical section of the GRE. Test performance showed that women who thought the experimenter was sexist performed more poorly than women in the condition in which sexism was not mentioned. Feedback had no effect of performance but did effect self-esteem; esteem was lower when students had received negative feedback. However, task performance was not affected by feedback. In Experiment 2, male and female students were exposed to the same sexism manipulation as in Experiment 1 but there was no manipulation of feedback. Although women again showed a tendency to perform more poorly when the experimenter was supposedly sexist, men actually performed better in the threat compared with the control condition. Self-esteem was again unaffected by the sexism manipulation, but women reported feeling less comfortable in the testing situation when sexism had been invoked. Experiment 3 varied the sex of the confederate so that male and female students in the threat conditions were informed by same-sex confederates that the experimenter was sexist (i.e., implying sexist against men for male students). Women again performed more poorly with a supposedly sexist experimenter, but men's performance was unaffected by this factor. Both man and women felt less comfortable in the situation if they thought the experimenter was exist, but self-esteem was unaffected by supposed experimenter sexism. In sum, these studies show that exposure to a sexist instructor can harm women's task performance and reduce their sense of comfort and belonging (but not necessarily their self-esteem). Although men also showed a lowered sense of belonging, their actual performance actually tended to improve under perceived sexism (i.e., they showed stereotype lift), perhaps because the gender stereotypes are suggestive of males' superior reasoning ability."

    "annotation": "Two experiments examined individuation processes as a buffer against stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, female undergraduates completed a task that highlighted their gender by presenting them with words on a computer screen related to women (stereotype threat ) or not related to women (control) below the level of conscious awareness. After this manipulation, half the students were asked to indicate their favorite food, movie, book, and hobbies and to list their three best and worst qualities (individuation condition) or answered a series of questions about topics unrelated to the self (non-individuation condition). After these tasks, all students completed a difficult math test. When not individuated, women performed more poorly when gender had been primed, consistent with traditional stereotype threat effects. However, women who had been led to individuate performed better and as well as students who had not been primed with gender. Experiment 2 replicated these effects with a different manipulation of individuation. These studies show that individuation can serve as a buffer against stereotype threat, perhaps because it allows a means for individuals to distance the self from identities linked to the stereotype in question."

In Experiment 1, Asian-American girls ranging in age from kindergarten to 8th grade completed tasks that were intended to highlight their Asian identity, their female identity, or neither identity (control). Following these tasks, all girls completed items from a grade-appropriate standardized math test. Girls from lower-elementary and middle school grades showed a similar effect: math performance was bolstered when Asian identity had been made salient but harmed when female identity had been made salient. Upper-elementary students, in contrast, performed best when their female identity had been highlighted. Experiment 2 focused on Asian-American boys. Boys in lower-elementary and middle school grades performed better in the gender and race identity than in the control condition, providing evidence of the potential beneficial consequences of stereotypes suggesting strong math performance. Upper-elementary boys performed better when gender than when race was highlighted. These results show that children can be affected by stereotype threat in a fashion similar to adults. Upper-elementary students showed a pattern that might reflect the typical presumed superiority of one's own sex group during upper-elementary years."

Young (average age 31.8 years), middle-aged (47.7 years), and old (69.4 years) normal functioning women and men were told they would complete several tasks involving memory. One-third of the participants were told that the tests revealed age differences (stereotype threat), one-third were told that the tests produce no age differences (stereotype invalidation), and one-third were told nothing about age difference on the test (control). Results showed that for individuals with less education (less than a 4-year college degree), recall was lower in both the stereotype threat and stereotype invalidation conditions compared with the control condition. Any mentioning of the elderly stereotype appeared to reduce memory performance, and this was true for all age groups. For those individuals higher in education (a 4-year college or more advanced degree), performance was higher in the stereotype invalidation compared with the other two conditions. Education rather than age moderated the effects of stereotype threat manipulations."

In two conditions, students were asked to write a letter of encouragement to a younger student who was experiencing academic struggles. In one of these conditions, students were prompted to endorse a view of intelligence as malleable, \"like a muscle\" that can grow with work and effort. In the second condition, students endorsed the view that there exists different types of intelligence. The third condition served as a control condition in which students were not asked to compose a letter. Several days after the intervention, all students were asked to indicate their identification with and enjoyment of academics. Results showed that Black students in particular were more likely to report enjoying and valuing education if they had written a letter endorsing malleable intelligence. In addition, grades collected 9 weeks following the intervention were significantly higher for Blacks in the malleable intelligence condition. Whites showed a similar, though statistically marginal, effect. This study showed that encouraging students to see intelligence as malleable (i.e., embrace an incremental theory of intelligence) can raise enjoyment and performance in academic contexts."

    "annotation": "These experiments examined self-assessments of ability and performance among Blacks who expected to be judged in terms of racial stereotypes. In Experiment 1, Black and White undergraduates were asked to complete items from the verbal section of the GRE exam and to indicate the likelihood that each response was correct. Blacks who indicated that they often expect to be judged in stereotypical terms performed more poorly but were more likely to indicate that their responses were correct than those who did not expect to be stereotyped. Blacks who did not expect to be judged in terms of stereotypes performed as well and were as accurate in their performance judgments as were White participants. In Experiment 2, Blacks and Whites regularly reported on their academic self-efficacy, athletic self-efficacy, and self-esteem over an 8-day period. Blacks who expected to be stereotyped showed higher variability in their reported academic efficacy over time, but showed no difference in the other domains. These results show that expectations of prejudice can affect accuracy of judgments about one's performance and academic efficacy. Inaccurate self-views and unstable efficacy can increase vulnerability to difficulty or negative feedback in academic contexts."

Immediately prior to taking the exam, participants were given several pictures of John McCain, Barack Obama, or no photographs (control) along with identical quotes attributed to each individual or to \"an American politician\" (control). Participants in these conditions were then asked to list two benefits of a McCain presidency, two benefits of an Obama presidency, or, in the control condition, the benefits of being politically informed. A second control condition involved participants completing the exam without being provided any of this information. Results showed that Whites performed significantly better than African-American students across all conditions. The authors suggest that the failure of focusing attention on Barack Obama in eliminating racial differences in test performance raise questions about his effectiveness as a role model. Given the timing of this experiment (mid-June to mid-July, 2008), it is quite plausible that data were collected at a time when Obama's accomplishments were not particularly clear or salient. Consistent with the findings of Marx, Ko, & Friedman (in press), having individuals think about Barack Obama does not always eliminate typical performance differences under stereotype threat."

In Experiment 1, White males with high math SAT scores took a difficult math test. In one condition, students were given information suggesting that Asians typically outperform other students in math. Moreover, the students in this condition were told that the study was designed to identify the nature and scope of differences in performance between Asians and other groups in mathematics. In a second control condition there was no mention of Asians, only information suggesting that the task was designed to assess mathematical ability. Participants in the first condition performed significantly worse than students in the control condition. Experiment 2 replicated this finding but also showed moderation by identification with mathematics; only those students who were highly identified with mathematics performed more poorly under stereotype threat. These studies show that stereotype threat can undermine performance of any individual who has a strong identity in a domain when context highlights stereotypes suggestive of relatively poor performance in that domain."

In Experiment 1, female undergraduates who identified strongly with the domain of math answered a set of math problems by themselves (control), in the presence of five other male students (solo condition), or in a mixed-gender group (non-solo condition). After being told they were to complete a series of math problems but before doing so, students completed word fragments designed to assess gender stereotype activation. Students then completed the math test. Average test performance was best in the non-solo condition and worst in the solo condition. Gender stereotypes appeared to be most accessible in the solo condition and least accessible in the control condition, but these differences were not significantly different. Moreover, stereotype accessibility was unrelated to performance. In Experiment 2, female undergraduates took the math test under solo or non-solo conditions but, prior to doing so, their performance expectations were measured. After completing the test, students were told that would complete another task with the group members and, at that time, measures of stereotype anxiety and interest in gender-related tasks were administered. Performance anxiety was higher in the solo compared with the non-solo condition but, surprisingly, there emerged no differences in math performance or performance expectations. However, across the conditions, anxiety regarding math performance was negatively correlated with performance, and performance was negatively related to expressed interest in female-related activities. These results suggest that anxiety plays a more direct role than stereotype activation in accounting for performance deficits under stereotype threat and that domain performance relates to the strength of group identification."

    "annotation": "These studies focused in the effects of stereotype threat on the performance of highly proceduralized activities. Unlike many tasks that rely on availability of attention and allocation of working memory capacity, performance on highly proceduralized skills can be harmed by increasing attention and cognitive involvement. Experiment 1 involved expert golfers who performed a putting test after being told either that \"women actually tend to perform better than men on our putting task\" (stereotype threat) or that \"this research was investigating individual differences in golf putting performance\" (control). Men in the control condition improved their performance between practice and test whereas test performance in the stereotype threat condition was worse than in the control condition. Experiment 2 used the same procedure but added for half the men a concurrent secondary task that required them to listen to a recording and to repeat certain words when they appeared. Golfers under stereotype threat actually performed better than in the control condition, suggesting that the concurrent task drew attention away from the proceduralized task. In Experiment 3, white male golfers performed the putting task after being told that \"natural athletic ability is the best predictor of performance success...certain minority groups may be especially predisposed to excel in golf\" (stereotype threat) or under control instructions and then performed a concurrent task involving monitoring words related to racial stereotypes. Even though the concurrent task might have reinforced stereotype threat, performance was improved in that condition. These results indicate that increased attention and allocation of working memory capacity can actually harm performance on proceduralized tasks. Thus stereotype threat can either harm performance by undermining working performance capacity or by causing working memory capacity to be allocated to processes that are harmed by increased attention or focus."

    "annotation": "This paper examines whether stereotype threat might reduce performance by imposing demands on the phonological component of the working memory system. If stereotype threat produces worries and concerns about the task at hand, then these worries might interfere with the part of working memory that is responsible for storing task-relevant verbal information. In Experiment 1, male and female math-identified participants completed easy and difficult tasks involving modular arithmetic under stereotype threat (with the study described as assessing \"why men are generally better than women at math\") or no stereotype threat (with the study assessing \"why some people are better at math than are others\"). Performance was poor only in the stereotype threat condition and only on problems that were difficult (i.e., horizontally-presented items that place high demands on working memory). In Experiment 2, participants completed math items that were high and low in the demands they place on working memory, and items were solved either as a single task or concurrently with a second task designed to reduce available phonological resources. Only completing demanding math problems reduced performance on the secondary task. Experiments 3A & 3B took advantage of this finding to assess the consequences of inducing stereotype threat. Highly-demanding math problems were less likely to be correctly answered under stereotype threat, and poor performance was accompanied by more self-reported task-related thoughts and worries. Experiment 4 showed that practice on demanding math items can attenuate stereotype threat effects, suggesting that practice reduces the demands of task performance on working memory capacity. Experiment 5 provided further evidence that stereotype threat affects the phonological component of working memory by demonstrating that performance on later unrelated verbal, but not on spatial, tasks were negatively affected following stereotype threat in math. These results show that stereotype threat undermines performance on tasks that are especially reliant on phonological resources and affects performance on subsequently encountered tasks that rely on those same resources. Moreover, practice and proceduralization can reduce the negative consequences of stereotype threat by reducing the need of phonological resources in problem solution."

    "annotation": "Two experiments examined the role of arousal in accounting for underperformance under stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, male and female students who were highly identified with mathematics were told that they would take a difficult math test. Half the students were told that there were typically no gender differences in performance on the test (no threat condition) whereas the other half were told nothing about the test (stereotype threat condition). After being told about the upcoming test, students either completed an easy task (wrote their name as many times as they could for 20 seconds) or a novel, difficult task (wrote their name backward as many times as they could for 20 seconds). No math test was ever given. Instead, based on the well-established finding that arousal improves performance on easy tasks but disrupts performance on difficult tasks, it was expected that women should show difference in the number of names they could write based on the presence of stereotype threat but that men should not. Results confirmed these predictions; women in the stereotype threat condition wrote significantly more forward names, but fewer backward names, in the stereotype threat than in the control condition. Men showed no effects of the stereotype threat manipulation. These results suggest that women under stereotype threat experienced increased arousal. Experiment 2 attempted to identify a means for disarming arousal under stereotype threat. Math-identified women completed a math test either in the presence of two other women (no threat) or with two men (stereotype threat) where results were to be reported aloud. Before taking the test, the participants were also shown a \"subliminal noise generator\" and were told either that the noise produced by the machine would produce no discernable effects or that it might create an increase in arousal, nervousness, and heart rate. Results showed that women in the stereotype threat condition performed more poorly on the math test but only in the condition where they were told that the noise machine would produce no obvious effects. When the women in the stereotype threat condition were provided with a means for attributing their arousal to an external cause (i.e., to the subliminal noise generator), performance was equivalent in the two conditions. Results from these studies indicate that arousal can arise under stereotype threat but that the effects of arousal can be attenuated if individuals are provided with a means for \"explaining away\" the arousal they may experience in such circumstances."

Male and female graduate students were asked to complete a lengthy exercise in which they made a series of decisions regarding personnel issues as though they were a senior manager in a human resources department, a stereotypically male position. Before beginning this exercise, the students were informed that the person who had previously held the position of senior manager was either a man who was described with stereotypically masculine traits (stereotype threat for women) or a woman described with stereotypically feminine traits (no stereotype threat). Women generally reported being less identified with the management activity, experienced more stereotype threat, and had more negative affect when placed on this stereotypical male role then men. Although these effects emerged across both conditions, task performance was harmed only in the stereotype threat condition. Women made fewer and poorer decisions (as reflected in raters' judgments of decision quality) when the previous manager was a stereotypical male compared with a stereotypical female. Interestingly, reduced performance was exhibited only by women low in masculinity; women who were high in masculine gender role identification (e.g., rated themselves as ambitious, self-reliant, independent, and assertive) did not perform more poorly under stereotype threat than men. This study illustrates underperformance by women under stereotype threat in the managerial domain but also suggests that gender role identification can buffer the impact of traditional gender stereotypes in this domain."

To test this hypothesis, female African-American students participated in a study in which they were put under stereotype threat by being told that \"the study was to standardize a new IQ measure of natural math ability.\" In addition, all students were asked to indicate their race on a form before beginning the math test. After completing the test, students encountered a same-race or White confederate (i.e., a person surreptitiously acting in collaboration with the experimenter) who indicated to the experimenter and the student that she had either performed very poorly or very well. The students then completed measures of current mood and state self-esteem. Results revealed no effects of experimental conditions on mood but significant effects regarding state self-esteem. In conditions where the confederate was White, a high reported performance by the confederate tended to produce lower self-esteem compared with a poor reported performance. In contrast, self-esteem moved in tandem with the confederate's reported performance in the same-race condition; reported high performance produced higher self-esteem than reported poor performance. These results suggest that self-esteem can be boosted under conditions that produce stereotype threat by providing role models who disconfirm negative stereotypes."

Black students in the condition designed to increase stereotype threat showed significantly elevated blood pressure, and the increase in blood pressure persisting up to 20 minutes beyond the testing session.

To do so, heterosexual and gay men briefly interacted with children in a nursery school after either indicating their sexual orientation (stereotype threat for gay men, given the stereotype that homosexuals pose a risk for young children) or not. Self-reported anxiety following the interaction did not reveal differences between those who had indicated their sexual orientation versus those who had not. However, gay men who had indicated their sexual orientation were more likely to exhibit non-verbal indications of anxiety during their interaction with the children (e.g., more fidgeting, lip chewing, nervous smiling, stiff posture, eye gaze aversion). In addition, gay men who indicated their sexual orientation provided less effective childcare than did men who did not do so, and decrements in care were predicted by non-verbal anxiety. These results show that stereotype threat can produce anxiety that might not be reported but that might manifest itself non-verbally. Moreover, anxiety arising from stereotype threat can harm the quality of interactions."

African-American and White undergraduates completed the APM after being given standard instructions that \"the Advanced Progressive Matrices is a measure of observation and clear thinking\" (standard), that it \"is an IQ test...frequently used to measure individuals\u2019 intelligence and ability\u201d (stereotype threat for African-Americans), or that it \"is a series of puzzles\" (low stereotype threat). Performance on the APM was assessed after controlling for differences in ACT scores across experimental conditions. Results showed that AMP performance was better for Whites than for African-Americans under high stereotype threat and standard instructions. However, the performance gap was eliminated (and even reversed, though not significantly) in the low threat condition, when the APM was described as a series of puzzles. These results show that stereotype threat can undermine performance on tests that are viewed as free of cultural bias and not reliant on reading skills or background knowledge. It also suggests that \"standard instructions\" used with many test instruments might invoke stereotype threat; only when the APM was described as a set of \"puzzles\" were performance differences between African-Americans and Whites eliminated."

    "annotation": "Three experiments examined whether men and women have different concerns when confronting a difficult math test that might account for stereotype threat effects. In Experiment 1, male and female undergraduates completed a math test after being told either that the test was designed to \"help us identify people who are exceptionally strong in their mathematical reasoning abilities\" (hypothesized to produce stereotype threat for men) or \"to identify people who are especially weak in their mathematical reasoning abilities\" (stereotype threat for women). Women in the latter condition performed more poorly than women in the former condition, but the opposite was true for men. These results suggest that both men and women were affected by stereotype threat when they believed that the gender stereotype applicable to their group was being assessed. Experiment 2 framed the test as being used to identify individuals weak in math (stereotype threat for women) but also introduced for half the participants a possible explanation for failure (i.e., a computer crash that precluded practice before taking a math test). Men were not affected by the computer failure, but women performed better if they had been precluded from practicing on the computer than if they had not been given this attribution for difficulty. Experiment 3 showed that a frame suggesting the test was being used to identify individuals exceptionally strong in math (stereotype threat for men) reversed the effect. Men performed better if they had been provided with an external attribution for failure, but women were not affected by this manipulation. These results suggest that men and women might face different specific types of stereotype threat. For men, the concern might be on meeting the positive stereotype that their group should do well in math. Although one might expect benefits when a positive stereotype is endorsed, pressure for the individual to meet a group-based stereotype might undermine performance. For women, their concern might focus on avoiding the stereotype that women are poor in math. In either case, providing an external attribution for failure appears to attenuate stereotype threat effects and, indeed, to improve performance."

    "annotation": "This experiment examined the moderating role of stigma consciousness on stereotype threat. Stigma consciousness refers to differences in the degree that individuals are chronically aware and conscious of their stigmatized status. Whereas individuals low in stigma consciousness typically report that they are unaware of their stereotyped status when interacting with other people and assume that stereotypes will not affect them personally, individuals high in stigma consciousness expect others to interpret their behavior and to judge them through the lens of stereotypes. Female undergraduates who were identified with math and who differed in stigma consciousness were recruited for participation in a study involving mathematical ability. Students were told either that the math test they were to take was \"completely free of gender bias\" (control) or that the test was designed \"to explain why men and women perform so differently on standardized math tests\" (stereotype threat). Women in the latter condition also indicated their gender before taking the test. Test performance revealed that only women high in stigma consciousness were negatively affected by the stereotype threat manipulation; women high in stigma consciousness performed more poorly in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. In contrast, women low in stigma consciousness performed equally well in the stereotype threat and control conditions. The results suggest that awareness and expectation that one will be judged in terms of gender stereotypes produces stronger effects when stereotype-based performance expectations are invoked."

Interspersed throughout the testing booklet were blank sheets on which students were encouraged to \"write anything that comes to your mind.\" These thought listings were classified by coders who were unaware of the students experimental condition as reflecting i) negative math related thoughts, ii) hatred of math, iii) general distress, iv) self-confidence, or v) neutral references to the test. Consistent with previous studies, women performed more poorly under stereotype threat than in the control condition, and performance differences increased from the beginning to the end of the test. Significant differences were found between conditions regarding the frequency of negative math-related thoughts, but there were no significant differences in the frequency of the other categories. Moreover, the number of negative thoughts regarding incompetence and low ability in math appeared to account for the decreased performance in the stereotype threat condition. Whereas other work had suggested that stereotype threat might increase cognitive burdens, this experiment demonstrated that burden might reflect increased concerns with one's ability in the domain in question."

    "annotation": "One reason that stereotype threat might interfere with performance is because it lowers expectations regarding performance which, in turn, undermines performance quality. Two studies examined the consequences of stereotype threat on expectations of performance. In Experiment 1, female undergraduates completed a math task after being told that on tasks of logical\u2013mathematical abilities \"women obtain lower scores than males\" (stereotype threat), \"women obtain higher scores than males\" (no stereotype threat) or that \"no differences between men and women emerge\" (control). For women low in math identity, their expectations of performance and actual performance were unaffected by the manipulation. In contrast, for women high in math identity, expectations of performance were affected by the manipulation (higher expectations under no stereotype threat, followed by control, followed by stereotype threat), and performance mirrored these expectations. Expectations partially mediated the effects of stereotype threat on performance, but only for women identified with math. Experiment 2 attempted to assess whether expectations and performance might vary depending on the particular identity made salient through specific intergroup comparisons. Black Americans living in Italy experienced a manipulation to highlight either their race or their nationality, and they were told that this identity produced either superior or inferior performance on a test of verbal ability. When individuals were told that their a highlighted identity was associated with superior performance, individuals expected to do better on the verbal task and indeed did perform better than those whose identities were associated with poor performance. These effects emerged regardless of whether race or nationality was highlighted. However, the strength of racial (but not national) identity did interact with the other variables, leading to stronger decrements in performance when highly-identified Blacks were told that their racial group did not perform well. Expectancies again partially accounted for the decreased performance under stereotype threat but only among Black participants. These studies show that lowered expectations might account for performance decrements under stereotype threat, particularly among stigmatized and low-status groups."

    "annotation": "Individuals differ in the degree that they believe their experiences are caused by internal versus external causes. For individuals with a more Internal Locus of Control, their experiences and outcomes tend to be explained in terms of internal forces such as traits, ability, or effort. For individuals with a more External Locus of Control, events tend to be explained in terms of luck, fate, or others' actions. Although an Internal Locus of Control has generally been shown to predict higher effort and achievement, beliefs in internal causes might also make an individual more susceptible to stereotype threat. Two studies examined the relation between Locus of Control and stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, males and female high school students were told that high levels of either Logical Intelligence (stereotype threat for women) or Social Intelligence (stereotype threat for men) have been associated with higher levels of success in life or they were given no information about variables that predict success (control). All students then completed a difficult test that was ambiguous regarding the importance of logical versus social skills. Consistent with previous stereotype threat studies, female participants obtained higher scores in the Social Intelligence condition compared with to the Logical Intelligence and control conditions, but men obtained lower scores in the Social Intelligence condition compared with the Logical Intelligence and control conditions. An analysis examining the moderating role of Locus of Control showed that these effects were present only for individuals with an Internal Locus of Control. In Experiment 2, female students took a math test after being told either that \"there are clear differences in the scores obtained by men and women in logical-mathematical tasks\" (stereotype threat) or that \"there are no differences in the scores obtained by men and women in logical-mathematical tasks\" (no threat). Only women with an Internal Locus of Control showed a lowered performance under stereotype threat. Thus, although Internal Locus of Control usually has beneficial consequences in academic settings, it does appear to increase susceptibility to stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "Three studies examined the role of stereotype threat in accounting for memory deficits in older adults. Unlike previous studies on stereotype threat involved in memory and aging, these studies used socially involving stimuli and varied instructions that were given. In Experiment 1, older and younger adults read brief descriptions of behaviors supposedly performed by an individual (e.g., \"had a party for some friends last week\") either while trying to form an impression of the person (impression formation set) or while trying to memorize the sentences (memory set). Consistent with previous research, recall was higher under impression formation than memory instructions. Moreover, even though recall was lower for the older participants, the effect of instructions was equivalent for both age groups. Experiment 2 replicated these main effects but also included a measure of stereotype threat. Older participants were more likely to indicate stereotype threat regarding their memory performance, and the degree of threat mediated the relation between age and recall performance. Experiment 3 replicated the findings of Experiment 2 using a recognition memory task. These studies indicate that although impression formation instructions improve memory performance in older adults, they do not reduce stereotype threat experienced by older participants in experiments on memory. In addition, perceptions of stereotype threat worsened memory performance for older adults on both recall and recognition tasks."

Asian-American undergraduates highly identified in mathematics completed a task involving quantitative skills. Prior to performing the task, the women answered questions about the centrality and importance of their racial identity (race highlighted), their gender identity (gender highlighted), or about their personal identity (control). Performance was significantly worse in the racial identity compared with the control condition, but there was no significant difference between the control and the gender identity condition. Poorer performance on the mathematics task was at least partially attributable to self-reported difficulty of the women in the race salient condition to maintain their concentration on the task. These data show that even stereotypes of superior performance can interfere with effective functioning when those stereotypes are highlighted in a strong and public manner."

    "annotation": "Whereas stereotype threat involves an individual's fear that he or she might behave in a manner that confirms a stereotype of one's group, individuals might also show concern about the potential stereotype-confirming acts of other group members. This threat, termed collective threat, arises from the awareness that the poor performance of a single individual in one\u2019s group might be viewed as stereotype-confirming and generalized to one\u2019s group. A pilot questionnaire study confirmed that Black and Latino students reported more threat from collective threat and from being stereotyped than from stereotype threat. Moreover, only collective threat predicted lower self-esteem. In Experiment 1, Black undergraduates overheard an experimenter tell another African-American participant (an ally of the experimenter) that the research was focused on the \u201cvarious factors that affect performance on problems that demand strong reading and verbal abilities,\u201d and the confederate reacted by saying, \u201cI\u2019m so bad at these standardized tests\u201d (collective threat). In the control condition, the experimenter said to the confederate that research focused on \u201cvarious factors involved in solving verbal puzzles,\u201d and the confederate remarked, \u201cVerbal puzzles...I remember these\u201d (control). Participants did not complete the test but responded to measures assessing state self-esteem, racial stereotype activation, and stereotype distancing (reduced endorsement of stereotypical group activities). The distance between the seat selected by the participant and the confederate was noted. Results showed that the collective threat condition produced lowered state self-esteem, more stereotype distancing, lowered racial stereotype activation, and greater physical distancing compared with the control condition. These effects were stronger for those students who moderately rather than highly identified with their racial group. Experiment 2 produced similar effects when a participant expected an ingroup member to perform a stereotype-relevant task, but these effects did not emerge either when an ingroup member was expected to complete a stereotype-irrelevant task (i.e., an art test) or when an outgroup member (i.e., a White student) was challenged with a stereotypical task. In Experiment 3, women were exposed to a control or collective threat manipulation similar to Experiment 1 involving the domain of mathematics. Collective threat produced lower self-esteem, lower efficacy in math, higher gender stereotype activation, greater social distancing and less imitative behavior. These studies demonstrate that concerns about the performance of an ingroup member on a task that might confirm one's group stereotype can pose a threat to self-worth and produce attempts to distance (both psychologically and physically) the self from the ingroup member."

Students who self-affirmed did so by indicating values that were important to them and writing a brief essay indicating why those values were important. For students who did not self-affirm, they indicated their least important values and wrote an essay regarding why those values might be important to others. The effects on academic performance during the semester were dramatic. African-American students who had been led to self-affirm performed .3 grade points better during the semester than those who had not, and those benefits occurred both in the class where the intervention took place as well as other classes. Moreover, benefits occurred regardless of pre-intervention levels of demonstrated ability. The self-affirmation intervention appears to have attenuated the drop in performance that typically occurs for African-American students over time."

    "annotation": "These studies examined the consequences of critical feedback provided to White and Black students by a White mentor. Such situations are fraught with ambiguity when threatening feedback is provided to students who chronically face negative stereotypes about their group\u2019s capacities. In Experiment 1, Black and White undergraduates received detailed, largely negative feedback from a White reviewer on an essay they had composed. This criticism was either provided without additional elaboration (unbuffered criticism), was accompanied by a comment generally praising the writer's enthusiasm and general writing style (criticism + praise), or was prefaced with comments invoking high standards but also assurances that the student could meet those standards (criticism + standards + assurance). Black students were significantly more likely to view the reviewer as biased than Whites in the \"unbuffered\" condition and somewhat more likely to do so in the \"criticism + praise\" condition. In the \"criticism + standards + assurance\" condition, differences in perceived bias were eliminated. Moreover, self-reported motivation was lowest for Blacks who received unbuffered feedback, and identification with writing was lower for Blacks in the \"unbuffered\" and \"criticism + praise\" conditions compared with Whites. Experiment 2 unconfounded the roles of standards vs. assurance in feedback by randomly assigning White and Black students to receive \"unbuffered criticism,\" \"criticism + standards\",\" or \"criticism + standards + assurance\" feedback. Blacks suspected more bias than Whites but only in the \"unbuffered criticism\" condition, but Blacks' motivation was lower in both the \"unbuffered criticism\" and \"criticism + standards\" condition. Identification with writing was somewhat lower for Blacks than Whites in the \"unbuffered criticism\" condition. Across both experiments, an emphasis on high standards and student capability eliminated perceived bias, eliminated differences in motivation based on race, and preserved identification with the domain in question. These results suggest that feedback that might be viewed in terms of negative stereotypes differs in effectiveness, depending on the presence of an emphasis on high standards and assurance that the individual can meet those standards. Stereotype threat is eliminated and motivation and domain identification are increased by so-called \"wise\" mentoring that offers criticism accompanied by high expectations and the view that each student is capable of reaching those expectations."

A battery of measures were administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the students' first year, and students' grades were collected. Overall (and consistent with the presence of stereotype threat for minorities), ethnic minority students showed stronger ethnic identity, but also higher levels of avoidance goals and lower levels of perceived institutional academic support. Over the course of the year, minority students showed more pronounced increases in depression and anxiety compared with White students, and end-of-year grades were lower on average for minority than for Whites students. Higher levels of anxiety and depression at mid-year predicted lowered grades only for minority students, and stronger ethnic identity predicted poorer performance for minority but not White students. Higher levels of social support produced improvements in the grades of ethnic minority students (but did not affect Whites). These results are suggestive that stereotype threat experienced over the course of the first year in college can affect performance of ethnic minority students. Ethnic minority students showed greater psychological distress as the year progressed, and distress harmed academic performance. The strength of ethnic identification and degree of social support strengthened and attenuated these effects, respectively."

Low SES students solved fewer items than did high SES students, but this occurred only in the condition in which the task was described as assessing intellectual ability.

Both Science and Psychology majors in France (for which there are stereotypes suggesting higher intelligence among the former) were asked to complete a test that was described either as a valid measure of general intellectual ability (stereotype threat for Psychology majors) or as nondiagnostic of ability (control). An electrocardiogram measured HRV while students took the test. Performance on the test was lower for the Psychology compared with the Science majors, but only when the test had been described as diagnostic of intelligence. HRV data showed that both sets of students showed lower HRV in the diagnostic test condition, indicating increased mental load under evaluative scrutiny. However, decreased HRV was associated with poorer performance in the stereotyped group but marginally higher performance in the nonstereotyped group. Stereotype threat appears to increase mental workload, but that increased workload appears to undermine performance only for those belonging to groups who are expected to underperform in a domain."

Specifically, the notions that stereotype threat should emerge only among those highly identified with a domain and only with tests that push the limits of individuals\u2019 abilities was used to develop hypothesized models of the relation between testing and performance on a criterion. Both assumptions suggest that the test-performance relationship should be nonlinear for members of minority groups and that prediction of performance for minorities should be poorest at the highest levels of test performance. These assumptions were tested using the SAT to predict academic performance (focusing on women and Blacks in math) and with data from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to predict military job performance (focusing on Blacks in technical proficiency). Results using SAT data showed no evidence of nonlinear relationships, and equivalent effects for women, men, and blacks. Analyses of the ASVAB revealed a linear test-criterion relationship throughout range of scores one one test and a stronger test-performance relationship for soldiers in the top half of the test score distribution on a second test, regardless of race. The authors speculate that the failure to obtain effects inferred from stereotype threat theory might reflect either the need for explicit highlighting of minority status or gender prior to testing to produce stereotype threat effects or the fact that stereotype threat can be overcome by increased effort and motivation."

That work showed there was little support for the prediction that stereotype threat emerges only among those highly identified with a domain. Specifically, under the assumption that domain identification would be highest for those individuals at the upper end of the performance distribution, it was predicted that regression lines characterizing the test-performance relation would be non-linear for minorities but linear for Whites. Using two large data sets collected in real-life situations, the relation was linear for both groups. That study, however, did not utilize a direct measure of domain identification. In this study, women who expressed the intent to major in math or related fields were compared with women interested in other fields in performance on the SAT Math test. It was predicted that standardized scores in math should underpredict performance in another domain (specifically, English) of women highly identified in math compared with women not identified with the domain, again producing a non-linear test-performance relation for the former group. This prediction was tested using data a large dataset of White men and women who completed the Math SAT test and for whom English grades could be computed. For both men and women, higher Math SAT scores were negatively related to grades in English, but the strength of the relation was equivalent (and linear) for both groups. These data reinforce the call for caution in assuming that stereotype threat effects emerge in real high-stakes testing environments."

    "annotation": "This paper offers a re-analysis of data collected and presented by Stricker & Ward (2004), in which the claim was made that there were no \"effects of inquiring about ethnicity and gender on performance on [standardized] tests\" (p. 685). The current authors critique the use of conservative decision criteria used in the original analyses. Specifically, Stricker and Ward (2004) only considered results to be significant if p<.05 in the overall ANOVA, p<.05 for planned comparisons using a very conservative post hoc Bonferroni correction, and effect sizes were \u03b7>.10 and d>.20. While these criteria do minimize the chances of making a Type I error (erroneously claiming a significant effect), they also elevate the likelihood of making a Type II error (failing to detect a real, even if small, difference). Given the importance of standardized test performance in determining educational opportunities, career paths, and life choices, Danaher and Crandall argue that use of standard statistical decision criteria is misplaced in this context. Accordingly, these authors re-examined the data presented by Stricker and Ward (2004), but used criteria of p<.05 from the overall ANOVA and \u03b7\u2265.05 for determining significance. These small changes produced several conclusions differing with those offered by Stricker and Ward (2004). Timing of soliciting identity information interacted with gender in affecting AP Calculus AB Grades and Formula Scores. Women\u2019s performance on these measures improved and men's performance declined when when they were not asked about gender before taking the test. Put in different terms, soliciting identity information at the end rather than at the beginning of the test-taking session shrunk sex differences in performance by 33%. Analysis of performance on the Computerized Placement Test also yielded an identity timing x gender interaction, with women's performance improving substantially, and men's scores declining slightly, when they did not report their identities before taking the test. This re-analysis suggests that soliciting social identity information prior to test taking does produce small differences in performance consistent with previous findings in the stereotype threat literature that, when generalized to the population of test-takers, can produce profound differences in outcomes for members of different groups."

In Experiment 1, men and women completed a math test, then a reading comprehension test, and a second math test. The content of the reading comprehension essay served as the experimental manipulation. Two essays acknowledged gender differences in math performance but they attributed those differences either to genetic or experiential causes. A third essay denied gender differences in mathematics, and a fourth essay focused on gender but did not discuss performance in math. Performance on the math test was poorer for women who read intervening essays that either attributed math differences to genetic factors or that made gender salient without mentioning math performance compared with the essays emphasizing no gender differences or that attributed differences to experience. Experiment 2 replicated these effects with a different design. These results suggest that invoking a genetic or biological basis for stereotypes undermines performance, whereas attributing differences to experience might ameliorate stereotype threat effects."

    "annotation": "Three studies examined whether stereotype threat might arise from exposure to stereotype-confirming messages in television advertisements. In Experiment 1, male and female undergraduates highly-identified with math viewed a set of six television commercials that had aired on national broadcasts. Half of the students saw a set where two of the commercials were stereotypic of women (one portraying a woman so excited about an acne product that she bounced with joy on her bed and another showing a woman excitedly anticipating eating brownies made with a new mix), and the other half saw two counter-stereotypic commercials (one showing a woman exhibiting detailed knowledge of automotive engineering and another depicting a woman speaking intelligently about her concerns regarding health care). After viewing these commercials, participants completed a difficult math test and a measure of stereotype activation. Although both men and women in the stereotypic commercial condition exhibited greater activation of female stereotypes, only women showed a difference in math performance. Men and women performed equally well on the math test in the counter-stereotypic commercial condition, but women performed more poorly than men in the stereotypic commercial condition. Women's math performance was mediated by the accessibility of stereotype-related thoughts. Experiment 2 allowed male and female participants to choose the types of items they would complete after viewing sets of stereotypic or neutral television commercials. Men were not affected by the television commercials in terms of their selection of items related to math or verbal ability. However, women were less likely to attempt math items, and more likely to attempt verbal items, after viewing the stereotypic advertisements, and their performance on the math items was worse following the stereotypic compared with the neutral ads. In Experiment 3, women and men indicated their interest in pursuing various academic majors and careers after viewing the stereotypic or neutral ads. Whereas men's preferences were not affected by viewing ads, women's preferences for pursuing verbal domains increased, and their interest in pursuing quantitative domains decreased, after viewing stereotypic commercials. These studies show that exposure to realistic materials endorsing gender stereotypes can increase stereotype threat as reflected in poorer domain performance and reduced interest in domain-related activities and interests."

After watching the commercials, the students were asked to participate in a purported separate study on leadership. Students read a description of the study and were asked to indicate the role they preferred to play in the upcoming study. Women who viewed stereotypic commercials were more likely to indicate a preference for a subservient problem-solving role compared with a leadership role. In contrast, both women who watched the control commercials and men were equally interested in occupying leadership versus subordinate positions. Experiment 2 was a replication that also included a condition in which students were assured of no gender differences in problem-solving and leadership ability and a measure of gender-stereotype activation. When there were no assurances of gender equivalence, the results were consistent with those obtained in Experiment 1. Moreover, stereotype activation predicted decrease leadership interest for women. When students were assured of no gender differences in leadership ability, however, commercials had no affect on role preferences and stereotype activation did not affect role preferences. These studies show that stereotype threat imposed by mass media stereotypic representations can affect leadership aspirations in women."

    "annotation": "This study examined whether Black racial identity might moderate vulnerability to stereotype threat. Recent research on Black racial attitudes suggests that African-Americans conceptualize their racial identity in different ways, and the relative salience of various conceptualizations (termed statuses) can modulate inter-racial interactions. Pre-Encounter status tends to be associated with a de-emphasis or even denigration of being Black. Encounter status refers to an emphasis on race in one's self-identity. Immersion-Emersion pertains to the celebration of Black identity and culture but includes denigration of Whites, and Internalization status refers to a strong Black racial identity that is non-exclusionary and egalitarian. To examine whether racial identity status affects stereotype threat, African-American undergraduates completed subscales to assess the relative strength of each racial identity status. Later, they were randomly assigned to be exposed to a low, medium, or high level of stereotype threat before completing some verbal items from a standardized test. Students were told that the study focused on \"understanding how students respond when confronted with a challenging problem solving exercise\" (low threat), \"verbal ability or verbal intelligence\" (medium threat), or \"verbal ability or verbal intelligence\" and that they would complete another measure that, unbeknownst to them, was designed to highlight racial identity and racial identity attitudes (high threat). Results showed that test performance was best in the low threat, and worst in the high threat, condition. Internalization status was positively related to performance in the low threat, but not the high threat, condition. These findings suggest that Internalization attitudes can be helpful in low threat situations but may not protect against poorer performance under stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "Two studies assessed stereotype threat in two generations of Afro-Caribbean immigrants. It was hypothesized that second-generation immigrants might be more likely to show performance decrements under race-based stereotype threat, given a presumed shift in the importance of one identity (i.e., West Indian) to another (i.e., African American)and the greater exposure to race-based prejudice in the second generation. In Study 1, students of West Indian origin completed a survey designed to measure the perceived favorability of stereotypes of West Indians and African Americans, the level of identification with each group, and expectations of discrimination. First-generation immigrants identified more strongly as West Indians and this generation believed that stereotypes of West Indians were more positive than second-generation immigrants. Both groups viewed stereotypes of African Americans as less favorable than stereotypes of West Indians. The two groups did not differ in their expectations of discrimination. Given that second-generation immigrants were less likely to emphasize their West Indian identity, it was hypothesized that they might be more susceptible to race-based stereotype threat. In Study 2, a set of first- and second-generation immigrant college students completed a test that was described as diagnostic of verbal abilities and limitations (stereotype threat) or part of an exercise in test development (control). The race of the experimenter was also varied, so that half of the students had a Black experimenter and the others had a White experimenter. Test performance was lower for the second-generation students under stereotype threat compared with the control condition, but it actually improved under stereotype threat for first-generation immigrants. In addition, first-generation immigrants performed better overall in the presence of a White experimenter whereas second-generation students performed better with a Black experimenter. Taken together, these findings suggest that second-generation immigrants are more likely to identify as an African-American and show stereotype threat effects typically found among African American students. In contrast, first-generation immigrants are more likely to identify as West Indians and show stereotype lift resulting from positive perceived stereotypes associated with that identity."

We are trying to analyze whether this difference exists.\u201d (stereotype threat). The other half of students heard no mention of gender differences in math (control). The stereotype threat manipulation did not affect performance on either the math test or the mental rotation exercise. However, analyses focusing on the role of math anxiety significantly qualified the effects of stereotype threat; girls under stereotype threat with low levels of math anxiety performed better on the math test than did girls with high levels of anxiety. Anxiety did not affect math performance when girls were not under stereotype threat, nor did it affect the performance of boys. These results show that gender-based stereotype threat in math might be displayed only by girls with high levels of pre-existing anxiety. Given that stereotype threat produced opposing effects in girls depending on the level of math anxiety, the authors suggest that the construct validity of stereotype threat should be questioned."

According to a recent analysis by the World Economic Forum, the gaps between men and women in Sweden on economic, political, education, and health variables are the smallest in the world. Swedish male and female undergraduate math and chemistry majors completed a difficult math test that, they were told, would allow comparison of their scores against those of the other students to assess their math ability. Half the students were told that there were typically no differences in test performance based on gender (no stereotype threat) whereas the other half were told that math ability of men versus women would be compared using student performance to reflect the math ability of each gender (stereotype threat). In addition, only students in the latter condition were asked to indicate their gender before taking the test. Results showed that females and males performed similarly in the absence of stereotype threat. Under stereotype threat, however, only women who were not strongly identified with their gender showed performance decrements. These data contrast with previous demonstrations showing stereotype threat effects among individuals highly identified with a threatened identity, and they suggest that a strong gender identity in a culture emphasizing gender equality might buffer identified women against stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "Two correlational studies examined the buffering role of coping sense of humor in stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, men and women undergraduates completed the Coping Humor Scale (CHS), a measure designed to assess the use of humor as a coping strategy for dealing with stressful situations and then answered two questions about how well they typically perform on math and verbal sections of standardized tests. For women, CHS scores were correlated with estimates of their math, but not their verbal, test performance. Women with higher levels of coping humor reported performing more positively on math tests. For men, CHS scores were not significantly correlated with reported test performance. In Experiment 2, women completed the CHS then were asked to complete a math test that reflected \"people's mathematics ability and limitations\" and typically reflected gender differences (stereotype threat for women) or that focused on assessing problem-solving processes for which there are no gender differences (no stereotype threat). In the stereotype threat condition, women high in CHS performed better than women low in CHS. There was no effect of CHS under low stereotype threat. Mediational analyses suggested that a coping sense of humor improved performance under stereotype threat by reducing the anxiety typically produced in such circumstances. These studies show that individuals with a coping sense of humor are less likely to manifest the typical consequences of stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "This study examines how White's completion of an implicit measure of racial attitudes might actually present a risk of confirming the stereotype that Whites are racially biased. To test this notion, White undergraduates in Experiment 1 completed an implicit measure of race-based associations (the race Implicit Association Task (IAT); Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) after being told nothing about the measure (control), that the measure indicated \"racial bias\" (high threat) or that responses to the measure reflected knowledge of, but not personal belief in, racial stereotypes (no threat). Results showed that performance was worst (i.e., most confirming of implicit racist associations) in the high threat condition and best in the no threat condition, with performance in the control condition between these two extremes. Even performance in the control condition showed evidence of stereotypic race-based associations, however, indicating that the absence of stereotype threat did not completely eliminated traditional racial associations. Experiment 2 replicated these effects but also showed that they were moderated by individual differences in motivation to control prejudiced responses. Specifically, IAT scores indicating stereotypical associations were higher under stereotype threat to the degree that individuals were concerned about appearing unbiased. Experiment 3 had White students complete the IAT under threat or no threat, but half the students were first allow to affirm their commitment to being nonracist. When allowed to self-affirm, threat had no affect on IAT scores. Without affirmation, however, IAT scores were higher under high threat than no threat. Only those individuals motivated to control prejudice responses but not allowed to affirm commitment to nonracism showed higher IAT scores under high compared with no threat. These data show that Whites who are threatened by the possibility of seeming racist produce elevated IAT scores, that Whites motivated to control prejudiced are ironically particularly vulnerable to this stereotype threat effect, and that opportunities to affirm one\u2019s commitment to nonracism attenuate this effect."

    "annotation": "Four experiments investigated the role of stereotype threat in affecting physical proximity during intergroup interactions. It was hypothesized that White individuals' fear of confirming the stereotype that Whites are racist would produce physical distancing during interracial interactions even in the absence of interracial animosity. In Experiment 1, White male undergraduates were told they would have a conversation with two other individuals. The race of these supposed conversation partners (depicted in photographs) was varied so that they were both either White or Black. In addition, the supposed conversation topic was manipulated to be about racial profiling (stereotype threat for Whites) or about love and relationships (control). After the manipulation of conversation topic, students completed three measures designed to assess the strength of their White racial identity, their strength of their stereotype of Whites as racist, and their general social anxiety. Students were then led to a room containing three chairs and were asked to arrange them so that they could have a \"comfortable conversation\" with their partners. No conversation took place, and the distance between chairs served as the primary measure in the study. Results showed that chairs were placed furthest apart in the condition in which White students thought they were going to discuss racial profiling with Black students. The strength of the stereotype that Whites are racist also uniquely predicted physical distancing. In Experiment 2, White male students were randomly assigned to supposedly discuss with White and Black partners racial profiling (as in Experiment 1) or were told that they would have to read a pro-racial profiling essay to their interaction partners and to argue a pro-profiling position. However, they were also told that the interaction partners had been made aware that their advocated position was assigned and not chosen, reducing the threat posed by presenting a racially charged argument. Results showed that students intended to sit further from the Black partners when they expected to discuss profiling but sat closer, and equally for with White compared with Black partners, when they had been assigned to advocate in favor of profiling. These results suggest that when the conversation was presumably uninformative about students' true attitudes (when all discussants knew the position was assigned), the topic was not threatening and physical distancing did not occur. Interethnic anxiety and stereotype strength of White racism both moderated physical distancing with Black partners, but explicit an implicit racial attitudes (measured earlier) did not. In Experiment 3, students completed a procedure similar to Experiment 2 but also read essays to encouraging either learning goals to induce an incremental orientation or performance goals to induce an entity orientation (Dweck, 1999). Physical distancing effects were eliminated when students had been encouraged to embrace an incremental view. Experiment 4 demonstrated similar effects with just one Black partner and also showed that individuals have conscious access to feelings of threat that predicted their behavior. These studies demonstrate behavioral consequences for Whites anxious about being seen as racist but also show the moderation of these effects when individuals embrace an incremental view of ability."

Male and female students in the last course of an advanced university calculus sequence were given a practice test containing items similar to the GRE. All students were told that the test was \"aimed at measuring your mathematical abilities\" (stereotype threat) but half of the students additionally were assured that \"this mathematics test has not shown any gender differences in performance or mathematics ability\" (stereotype threat negation). Test performance was higher for women than men in the stereotype threat negation condition but was equivalent in the stereotype threat condition. Assessment of course grades showed that female and male students did not differ significantly in the grades they received at the end of the semester, but practice test scores overpredicted final grades for women on the stereotype threat negation condition. In other words, women who were told that there was no test bias performed better on the practice test than would have been predicted from their final grades. These results provide a clear demonstration of elimination of stereotype threat in a real-world environment with individuals who are high achieving in the domain in question. Moreover, the findings also show that even tests described as diagnostic of ability need not impose threat if assurances of test fairness can be made."

Seventh grade students received a college-aged mentor for a full academic year with whom they discussed adjusting to a new school environment and effective strategies for studying. Different mentors, however, had been directed to introduce other issues for discussion. One group emphasized the expandable nature of intelligence and the plasticity of brain and neural development over life. A second group emphasized that students often experience difficulty transitioning to a new school and that these challenges are typically overcome with time, thereby providing an unstable, external attribution for academic struggle. A third group of mentors emphasized both messages. Subsequent performance on a statewide standardized tests of math and reading of students in these three conditions were compared with the performance of a control group whose mentors emphasized an anti-drug message. Results showed that males outperformed females in math in the control condition, but there were no significant differences between boys' and girls' scores in the other three conditions. For reading, mentoring emphasizing expandable intelligence and external attributions for difficulty produced higher scores than the control condition, but the combined message did not produce a significant difference compared with the control condition. This study demonstrates that interventions that have been shown to reduce stereotype threat in laboratory settings can be utilized to improve performance in real-world contexts and to eliminate group differences in performance on standardized tests."

    "annotation": "This experiment examined the role of multiple identities in attenuating stereotype threat. Male and female undergraduates who varied in their level of identification with math were asked to answer some questions that supposedly were to be used in a new version of the GRE math test. To induce stereotype threat, researchers told the students that the test was being used \"because of the well-known stereotype that men usually outperform women on math tests\" (stereotype threat for women). Before taking the math test, some participants were asked to create self-concept maps as an exercise involving graphical representation. Whereas some participants did not create a self-concept map, others were induced to form simple maps (reflecting the person's \"most basic or fundamentally important characteristic\") or complex maps (reflecting \"a complete description\" of the person). In contrast with individuals who did not make self-concept maps or who made simple maps, women who made complex self-concept maps were unaffected by the stereotype threat manipulation. Women who made no maps or simple maps performed more poorly under stereotype threat if they were highly identified with math, whereas performance of women not highly identified with math did not differ across the conditions. In addition, women who were highly identified with math performed as well as men if they had created complex self-maps. Performance deficits under stereotype threat were alleviated by prompting women to think of themselves in a multifaceted manner."

    "annotation": "This experiment examined the impact of proactive personality \u2014 the tendency to take action to change one's circumstances \u2014 and stereotype threat on women's aspirations in entrepreneurial fields. Given that characteristics stereotypically assumed to produce entrepreneurial success are masculine in nature, it was hypothesized that exposing women to these stereotypes might reduce their expressed interest in pursuing a career in business. To test this hypothesis, women enrolled in a university business program read an article about entrepreneurship. For half of the women, the article emphasized the importance of masculine attributes in producing business success (e.g., aggressive, autonomous, risk-taking) (stereotype threat), and the other half read an article emphasizing gender-neutral characteristics (e.g., creative, well-informed, steady) (control). After reading the article, all women completed a measure designed to assess their interest in pursuing an entrepreneurial career. Results showed that for women high in proactive personality, stereotype threat reduced their intentions to enter the business field. For women low in proactive personality, stereotype threat also appeared somewhat to reduce intentions to enter business but not to a statistically significant degree. These results show that stereotype threat can reduce engagement and can lower the intention to pursue a career in a threatened domain, particularly (and perhaps ironically) for women who are most likely to act in response to their circumstances."

Similar to Croizet & Claire (1998), students who were low and high in SES participated in the study. Unlike Croizet & Claire, middle-class students were also included, and both White and minority students were included in the sample. Students completed a difficult math and verbal test with instructions suggesting that the test provided a \"valid assessment of their abilities\" and that \"middle and upper income students consistently performed better than lower income students on standardized tests\" (stereotype threat for low SES) or that the \"purpose of the research is to understand the psychological factors involved in completing standardized tests\" (control). After completing the tests, students completed scales designed to measure effort exerted, domain identification, test anxiety, and state self-esteem. Results indicated that lower SES students performed worse on both tests in the stereotype threat than in the control condition, whereas high SES students performed better on both tests in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. Middle-class students did not perform differently on the tests in the two conditions. Results on anxiety mirrored these effects, but results regarding domain identification showed only that low SES students identified less with English and math under stereotype threat compared with the control condition. The only significant effect involving race showed that White lower income students identified less with English than did non-White lower income students. There were no significant effects of any variables on effort exerted and self-esteem. This study adds to the understanding of social class effects in stereotype threat."

Results indicated that older adults who received the stereotype-consistent information performed worse on a recall task than those who received either stereotype-inconsistent or no information.

Adults between the ages of 24 to 86 were recruited from a community to participate in the study.

Participants then were allowed to study a list of 30 words for two minutes and later wrote down all the words they could recall. Recall performance of the youngest and oldest participants was not affected by stereotype threat. Stereotype threat effects emerged for adults in their 60s, but participants in their 40's showed a stereotype-contrasting effect with better memory performance in the stereotype-confirming compared with the stereotype-disconfirming condition. Beliefs about the controllability of memory increased and aging-related concerns about memory decreased for participants who read the stereotype-disconfirming information. In the stereotype-confirming condition, controllability decreased and aging-related concerns increased. Changing beliefs moderated memory performance, with older adults whose beliefs became more positive following the stereotype manipulation showing better recall than those whose beliefs became more negative. Although stereotype threat effects occurred for some age groups, the activation of positive and negative stereotypes had different effects depending on age. These findings highlight the importance of group identification in producing reduced memory performance under stereotype threat."

In Experiment 1, highly math-identified boys and girls between 11-13 years in age were presented with a version of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) recall memory task, an exercise believed to tap a variety of skills essential for successful academic performance. Half the students were told that the task was a \"geometry test\" (stereotype threat for girls) and the other students were told it was a \"memory game\" (no stereotype threat). Results showed that girls' memory performance was superior when the task was described as a memory game compared with a geometry test, and boys' performance was better when the task was described as a geometry test compared with a memory game. Experiment 2 provided a conceptual replication but in an ordinary classroom environment. Experimenters entered classrooms and created two mixed-gender or same-gender groups of students. Students were presented with the ROCF and were told either that the task provided a test of their \"ability in geometry\" or their \"ability in drawing.\" After entering math grades as a covariate, the memory results showed that the results of Experiment 1 replicated in mixed-gender groups. Girls outperformed boys in the \"drawing\" condition but performed more poorly in the \"geometry\" condition. In single-sex groups, there were no significant effects of task description. Girls in the \"geometry\" conditions reported the task as being more difficult than did boys. In addition, when asked to identify students who were high performing in math, girls in the mixed-gender, geometry condition were more likely to nominate a boy than a girl, but girls in the same-gender condition were more likely to specify a girl. The gender of the specified high-performing student mediated girls' memory performance, suggesting that imagining female role-models helped girls to perform well in single-sex settings even under conditions where the task description typically produces stereotype threat. These experiments provide evidence of stereotype threat effects in realistic classroom environments and also highlight conditions that qualify the emergence of performance decrements under threat."

Individuals high in self-monitoring were expected to show fewer performance decrements under numerical-minority status (a condition that typically creates stereotype threat) because their habitual and well-practiced impression-management strategies reduce the threat imposed by situations involving potential stereotype confirmation. Experiment 1 tested this hypothesis by having math-identified female undergraduates complete a difficult math test either in the presence of one female and two males (minority status) or three females (same-sex). High self-monitors tended to outperform low self-monitors in the minority status condition, although this effect was not statistically significant. Somewhat surprisingly, low self-monitors outperformed high self-monitors in the same-sex condition. Experiment 2 focused on the performance of Black undergraduates who completed a difficult verbal test in the presence of one Black and two Whites, two Blacks and one White, or three Blacks. Before completing the test, a measure of stereotype activation was administered. In the presence of two Whites, high self-monitors outperformed low self-monitors and this pattern also emerged in the condition in which there was one White. Performance generally decreased as a function of the number of Whites in the testing environment, regardless of self-monitoring. Self-monitoring effects were absent in the same-race condition. Stereotypes regarding African-Americans were more accessible to the degree that there were more Whites in the testing environment, but the effects of this increased accessibility differed as a function of self-monitoring. High self-monitors' performance increased, but low self-monitors' performance tended to decrease, with greater stereotype accessibility. These findings suggest that individuals high in self-monitoring are resilient to pressures typically posed by minority status situations."

The women had been led to believe that their scores would be shared at the end of the testing session. Women performed more poorly on the math items in the presence of two males compared with two females, but performance on the verbal items was equivalent. In Experiment 2, student participants completed just the math items, but male participants were included and a mixed-sex condition was added (i.e., 1 female and 1 male accomplice). Consistent with Experiment 1, women on average performed more poorly when in the presence of two men, but men were unaffected by the gender composition of the group. Results also showed that women's performance decreased in proportion to the number of fellow male test-takers. These results show that the social context alone, specifically being a numerical minority in a situation where a group-based stereotype might apply to one's behavior, can create stereotype threat and undermine performance."

If self-control is a limited resource, then coping with anxious feelings and activated stereotypes, and avoiding stereotype-confirmation under stereotype threat might reduce the resources available to effectively regulate behavior in other unrelated contexts. Three experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. In Experiment 1, African-American undergraduates completed measures designed to assess their anxious expectations of being victims of prejudice and their estimates of successful regulation of academic-relevant behavior. Responses to these measures were negatively correlated; individuals who expected to be victims of prejudice reported lowered ability to regulate behavior related to academic success. Experiment 2 involved Black and White undergraduates who completed a task requiring high levels of self-regulation (the Stroop task) after being led to expect that they would later complete a difficult verbal exam described as being either diagnostic (stereotype threat for Blacks) or nondiagnostic (no stereotype threat) of intellectual ability. Stroop performance was poor for Blacks under stereotype threat compared with Blacks under no stereotype threat and Whites overall. Experiment 3 involved women who were led to believe they would complete a math or verbal test that either was or was diagnostic of ability (stereotype threat for math) or showed no gender differences (no stereotype threat). Before beginning the test, the women were asked to hold a handgrip as long as they could, a task requiring self-regulation of physical resources. Women held the handgrip for a shorter period when they believed they were to take a diagnostic math test compared with the other three conditions. These studies show that stereotype threat can reduce the ability to regulate both attentional and physical behavior."

    "annotation": "This paper reports four experiments testing the notion that one consequence of stereotype threat is increased motivation to perform well. Increased motivation to perform should facilitate the dominant response on a given task, and dominant responses, if correct, should improve task performance. If the dominant response is incorrect, however, then performance should be harmed under greater motivation. To test these hypotheses, students completed a visual attention task (an antisaccade task) in which an individual must inhibit the tendency to look at an irrelevant, peripheral stimulus while directing vision to determine the orientation of a target stimulus. In Experiment 1, in which the target display duration was set to 150 ms, undergraduate men and women completed this task after it had been described as \"linked to math ability\" that either had \"been shown to produce gender differences\" (stereotype threat for women) or \"not been shown to produce gender differences\" (control). Women under stereotype threat rated the task as more difficult, and women in the stereotype threat condition were less accurate than students in all other conditions in reporting the orientation of the target stimuli. In Experiment 2, in which only women performed, the target display duration was increased to 250 ms which provided threat participants with the opportunity for correcting for the dominant response. At this duration, women in the stereotype threat condition reported target orientation more quickly than controls with no cost in accuracy. Experiment 3 tracked eye movements and showed that women under stereotype threat were more likely to look at the irrelevant cue (demonstrate the dominant response) but were also better able to quickly correct for this error than women in the control condition. On trials where individuals successfully avoided looking at the irrelevant cue, eye glances toward the target were initiated more quickly in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. Experiment 4 crossed the stereotype threat manipulation with a manipulation of cognitive load. Results under low cognitive load replicated previous findings at the 250 ms display duration: women under stereotype threat responded more quickly than women in the control condition with no cost in accuracy. However, under high cognitive load, women under stereotype threat performed more poorly than women in the control condition. Thus, when working memory was impaired, the performance advantage of threat participants was not only eliminated, but reversed. The authors argue that these findings are consistent with the mere effort account, but not with a working memory account, which they contend would also predict more looking toward the cue (a result of impaired capacity to inhibit a dominant response), but would predict slower, not faster, attempts to initiate corrective saccades and would not predict faster response times when the threatened individuals\u2019 eyes reached the target area. These results are suggestive that stereotype threat can produce increased motivation to perform on the threat-relevant task and that performance on relatively simple tasks can be facilitated by stereotype threat. Of course, increased motivation might not always benefit task performance, and other factors such as task difficulty play a role in determining the consequences of increased effort. In addition, other demonstrated consequences of stereotype threat (e.g., increased distraction, lowered expectations) might also play roles along with motivation and effort in determining task performance."

    "annotation": "This paper examines the role of emotion regulation in stereotype threat. It is proposed that stereotype threat provokes a variety of emotional responses. To regulate (i.e., control) these emotional responses requires working memory resources, depriving the individual under threat of the cognitive resources needed for optimal task performance. These ideas were pursued across four experiments. In Experiment 1, female undergraduates were asked to perform a task measuring mathematical aptitude in the presence of two men (stereotype threat) or reflective of problem solving skills in the presence of two other women (control). Participants then completed tasks designed to assess working memory capacity and attention to threat relevant stimuli. For the attention task, half of the women were given a vague description of the task \u2212 so the task would function as a measure of the accessibility of threat emotions \u2212 and half were told that it would measure whether they were experiencing anxiety. It was expected that this latter group would try to regulate their responses resulting in lowered attention to threatening stimuli. Results showed that women under stereotype threat showed lower working memory capacity. However, only women under stereotype threat who were given a vague description of the attentional task showed greater attention to threat-relevant stimuli. Women under stereotype threat who were told of the nature of the task showed reduced attention to the threatening stimuli compared with the control condition, suggesting that they were regulating their responses. Experiment 2 focused on varying the strategies used for emotional regulation under stereotype threat. To induce stereotype threat in all participants, experimenters told female undergraduates that they would complete a test measuring mathematical ability. One-third of the participants were given no additional information (stereotype threat alone), one-third were instructed to suppress their feelings and emotions during the experiment (stereotype threat plus suppression), and the remaining third were told to look at the test in an objective, analytical manner so as to depersonalize it (stereotype threat plus reappraisal). Women in the reappraisal condition performed better on tests of working memory capacity and on the actual math test than did women in the other two groups (who did not differ from each other). These results suggest that effective emotional regulation can preserve capacity and ensure successful performance. Experiment 3 showed that instructing participants under stereotype threat that any anxiety they would experience would not harm (and might even help) test performance eliminated performance decrements compared with conditions under which stereotype threat was induced but anxiety was not mentioned. Experiment 4 extended these findings by including Latino and White undergraduates in a study designed to assess group differences on intelligence tests (stereotype threat for Latinos). Half of the participants were also told that the study would examine the role that anxiety plays in test performance (anxiety mentioned) and half were told that anxiety would not affect or might even improve their test performance (anxiety reappraised). Only Latinos in the anxiety mentioned condition showed reduced attention to threat relevant stimuli, suggesting that they were attempting to suppress (i.e., regulate) anxious emotions. Moreover, these participants performed most poorly on the measure of working memory capacity. Taken together, these studies show that the process of emotional regulation in response to stereotype threat can tax cognitive resources, producing poorer performance under threat."

In a third condition, the task was described as a math test but students also were briefly told about stereotype threat and that it could negatively affect women's performance on the test. Specifically, students were told, \"it's important to keep in mind that if you are feeling anxious while taking this test, this anxiety could be the result of these negative stereotypes that are widely known in society and have nothing to do with your actual ability to do well on the test.\" When the task simply was described as a math test, women performed worse than men, confirming previous findings. When the task was described as a problem-solving task or when women were taught about stereotype threat, the performance of women and men did not differ. This study suggests that teaching students about stereotype threat and providing a means for explaining the anxiety that might be experienced under it can reduce its negative consequences."

    "annotation": "Stereotype threat can be conceptualized as a situation involving the potential loss of status for a group member. Given that baseline testosterone levels have been shown to be related to status-relevant concerns and behavior in both humans and other animals, it was hypothesized that individual differences in baseline testosterone might moderate stereotype threat effects. In Experiment 1, highly math-identified male and female undergraduates completed a math test after answering questions that focused on gender stereotypes in math (stereotype threat for women) or coming to college (control). Before taking the test, however, all participants provided saliva samples allowing analysis of baseline testosterone levels. Testosterone levels interacted with participant sex and stereotype threat to affect performance on the math test. For women exposed to negative stereotypes of their group, increased testosterone levels produced poorer math performance, but there were no effects of testosterone level in the control condition. Men outperformed women overall, and scores were not affected by stereotype exposure or testosterone level. In Experiment 2, men highly identified with math provided saliva samples then completed a math test that was described as useful for identifying \"only individuals who were 'exceptional' in math ability\" (status-enhancement potential) or \"only individuals 'weak' in math ability\" (no status-enhancement potential). Males high in testosterone outperformed men low in testosterone in the status-enhancement condition. In contrast, there was no difference in performance between high and low-testosterone males when the framing offered no possibility of status-enhancement. These data lend support to the notion that stereotype threat effects occur due to status-relevant concerns and that the specific content of stereotypes predict whether those concerns will augment or attenuate performance."

In the experiment, female undergraduates completed a math test that was described as either diagnostic (stereotype threat) or nondiagnostic (control) of mathematical ability. After finishing the task, they completed implicit measures (see Greenwald et al., 1998) of gender stereotyping (i.e., stronger male-math than female-math associations), gender identification (i.e., stronger self-female than self-male associations), and math identification (i.e., stronger self-math than other-math associations), and an explicit measure of math-gender stereotyping. Math performance was lower in the threat compared with the control condition, but math performance was also moderated by implicit gender stereotyping. In the control condition, stronger implicit gender-math stereotypes predicted lower math scores. In the stereotype threat condition, implicit gender stereotyping was unrelated to math performance. There were no significant effects associated with implicit gender or implicit math identification or explicit math-gender stereotyping. These data suggest that women with stronger implicit stereotypes linking men with mathematics are more susceptible to the negative consequences of stereotypes, even in conditions that typically do not give rise to stereotype threat."

The other half of the students were told nothing about gender differences on the task (control). Consistent with previous stereotype threat findings, boys and girls performed equivalently when gender differences were not mentioned, but girls performed worse than boys under stereotype threat. Girls under stereotype threat were more likely to self-handicap, indicating higher levels of agreement with the statements that they had been \"under a high degree of stress lately\" and that the test was \"tricky or unfair.\" Moreover, self-handicapping appeared to account for the performance decrements of girls under stereotype threat. Although self-handicapping can protect the self from the consequences of negative performance, it can also undermine motivation and engagement in the domain in which stereotype threat occurs."

Although these factors have been examined in separate settings, this study examined the effects of all three variables within a single design and in a realistic school setting. Male and female German secondary school students who took math as a regular subject were asked to complete a difficult math task under one of two conditions. Half of the students were told that the task tends to produce gender differences (stereotype threat for girls), whereas the other half of the students were told that there were no gender differences on the task (control). Under stereotype threat, girls who highly identified with math performed more poorly than girls not identified with math. In the control condition, in contrast, highly-identified girls outperformed low-identified girls. Boys were not affected by the stereotype threat manipulation. Analyses including item difficulty showed that low-identified girls performed better on difficult items under stereotype threat than under control, but highly-identified girls performed more poorly on difficult than easy items under stereotype threat. These results show that threat heightens motivation with individuals low in identification producing enhanced performance, but stereotype threat undermines performance of individuals who are highly-identified with a domain, particularly on difficult test items."

    "annotation": "This experiment used predictions derived from Regulatory Focus Theory (Higgins, 1998) to examine performance under stereotype threat. Regulatory Focus Theory posits the co-existence of two systems involved in self-regulation. Whereas the promotion system is concerned about gain/non-gain and strives to achieve desired endstates, the prevention system focuses on loss/non-loss and strives to avoid undesired endstates. If stereotype threat involves the fear of confirming undesired stereotypes, then stereotype threat should have particularly detrimental effects on performance when the prevention system is activated and produce more modest effects under a promotion focus. To test this hypothesis, male undergraduates were given strategic instructions to induce a prevention or promotion focus then completed a verbal task that \"produced gender differences\" (stereotype threat) or has \"been shown to not produce gender differences\" (control). Under stereotype threat, performance was lower for participants using prevention compared with promotion strategies. There were no effects of regulatory focus in the control condition. These results suggest that stereotype threat effects are more likely when individuals are operating with a prevention rather than a promotion focus of self-regulation."

    "annotation": "This experiment used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the brain regions engaged as women performed math in the absence and presence of stereotype threat. Female undergraduates who highly identified with math completed a series of math problems while in an fMRI scanner (to establish baseline levels of brain activity) then completed a task to assess attitudes towards math because \"research has shown gender differences in math ability and performance\" (stereotype threat) or to assess political attitudes (control). All students then completed a second set of math problems. Results showed that math performance improved slightly from the first to the second set of problems in the control condition, but students in the stereotype threat condition performed somewhat worse on the second compared with the first problem set. fMRI data showed that women in the control condition showed heightened levels of activation in a network of regions central to math reasoning and performance, such as the angular gyrus. In contrast, women in the stereotype threat condition showed higher levels of activation of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been implicated in the processing of negative information. These data show that stereotype threat might undermine performance because brain regions necessary for mathematical reasoning are not activated to the degree necessary for success. Instead, neural structures associated with the processing of negative information receive heightened activation under threat. This study is the first to implicate patterns of neural activation as a possible mechanism in stereotype threat."

African adults who had lived in Belgium at least 5 years were recruited to complete a relatively culturally-unbiased test commonly used in job selection. The description of the test provided by an African experimenter was varied between conditions. Individuals were told that \"compared to Belgians, very few Africans have performed well on it\" (stereotype threat), that \"the number of Africans who have performed well on this test exceeds the number of Belgians\" (stereotype lift), or that \"there are as many Africans as Belgians who have performed well on this test\" (no difference). In a separate condition, no group differences in performance were mentioned (control). Performance was poorest in the stereotype threat condition, and individuals in this condition were more likely to agree with items asking whether they had been given too little time or information, that they were tired or distracted, or that the test was not appropriate given their nationality. Stereotype threat thus produced self-handicapping and disparagement of the test instrument. These results reveal negative effects of stereotype threat in an understudied population using an instrument commonly used in job selection in Belgium."

Following task failure, the students were asked to explain why they had failed at the task. Women who were placed under stereotype threat were more likely than men to attribute their failure to internal factors rather than external factors. There were no significant gender differences in the other two conditions. These data show that stereotype threat can lead individuals to blame themselves for failure."

The test was actually the Interpersonal Perception Task (IPT-15; Costanzo & Archer, 1993) that assesses individuals' accuracy in interpreting others' expressive behavior. Men performed more poorly on the task in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition, but women did not differ in their performance between conditions. Moreover, men in the stereotype threat condition who reported using more deliberative and less intuitive strategies showed larger decrements in performance, but this was not true for women or for men in the control condition. This is suggestive that stereotype threat might have reduced men\u2019s cognitive capacity, harming performance when they attempted to use a more deliberative strategy. This study provides another example of stereotype threat with a group (men) not typically stigmatized and offers some insight regarding the specific reason that threat harmed their interpersonal perception."

In Experiment 2, male-female negotiation dyads were told about traits that supposedly predicted poor performance in negotiation. Half of the participants were told that assertiveness, self-interest, rationality, and limited emotional expression predicted poor negotiating skills (male stereotypic disadvantage condition), and the other half were told that passivity, reliance on listening, reliance on intuition, and emotional display (female stereotypic disadvantage condition) were associated with poor negotiation skills. Women's performance was better in the male disadvantage condition but men's performance was better in the female disadvantage condition. These results show the malleability of stereotype threat effects, changing the group experiencing stereotype threat by modifying the attributes that are believed to produce success in a given domain."

In Experiment 1, male-female negotiation dyads were given either a strong or weak gender stereotype manipulation implying male superiority in negotiating. One of the negotiation partners was provided with social power by suggesting that they could leave the negotiation and still receive a good settlement, and the individual with high power was female in half the dyads and male in the other half of dyads. Results showed that high-powered negotiators were more effective than negotiators low in power, but this was true only when male gender stereotypes had been strongly instantiated. In addition, negotiators behaved in a more contentious fashion under the strong stereotype manipulation. These effects occurred regardless of gender, suggesting that women did not succumb to, but in fact reacted against, stereotype threat. In Experiment 2, stereotypes were either strongly or weakly invoked to suggest female superiority in negotiation. High-powered negotiators performed more effectively than low-powered negotiators, but joint payoffs were maximized in the strong female stereotype condition, suggesting that female stereotypes of generosity, attentiveness, and communication prevailed for both male and female negotiators in this condition. These results show that when stereotypes are activated explicitly, individuals low in power who are subjected to the limiting stereotype can assimilate their behavior to attributes that are tied to success in a domain."

    "annotation": "These experiments assess the impact of gender-stereotype activation on performance expectations in negotiation situations, a domain in which gender stereotypes favor men. In Experiment 1, MBA students formed male-female dyadic pairs to conduct a negotiation over the purchase of a biotechnology plant. Half of the negotiation teams were told that the negotiation task was extremely diagnostic of negotiating ability (stereotype threat for women) and half were told the task was not an accurate gauge of negotiating ability (control). Men expected to do better (and, in fact, did so) than did women in the former condition, but there were no differences in expectations or performance in the latter condition. In Experiment 2, one partner in female-male and male-male negotiation dyads were either told that effective negotiators are rational, assertive, and self-interested (i.e., traditional gender stereotypes of males designed to induce stereotype threat for women) or were given no information about traits (control). Results showed that men were more confident and more effective in negotiating with a woman, particularly when gender stereotypes had been invoked. Women's performance was no worse in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition, however, suggesting that women might have been operating under threat in both conditions. Experiment 3 employed a much stronger instantiation of gender stereotypes to test the hypothesis that stereotypes might at least in some circumstances lead to reactance, producing behavior in opposition to the activated stereotype. Male-female dyads completed the same negotiation used in Experiment 1, except before the task traditional gender stereotypes were linked to differential success (weak stereotype condition) or, additionally, participants were told that men tend to outperform women (strong stereotype condition). Women made stronger offers and were more successful than men in the negotiation only in the strong stereotype condition, suggesting that women sought to disprove the gender stereotype and did so successfully when stereotype activation was clear and strong. In Experiment 4, male-male and male-female dyads completed a negotiations with no mentioning of traits (control), with the strong stereotype instructions used in Experiment 3 (strong stereotype condition), or with instructions emphasizing the importance of a shared social identity (superordinate identification condition). Women in the strong stereotype condition achieved superior outcomes and showed evidence of distancing themselves from traditional female stereotypes. In contrast, men in that condition showed evidence of self-doubt and concern about failing to meet gender-based expectations of strong performance. These findings show that subtle manipulations of stereotype threat can undermine performance but that more explicit manipulations, at least in some individuals, can produce consequences in opposition to the activated stereotype."

In addition, highly identified women in the stereotype threat condition discounted the test more than did other participants. Specifically, they were more likely to agree with the statements, \"this test is not an accurate measurement of my math ability,\" \"I feel that I am better at math outside of this test,\" and to disagree with the statements, \"tests like this one are not biased against certain groups of people,\" and \"my score on this test will likely be an accurate measure of my math ability.\" Moreover, these differences in discounting emerged even when controlling for actual test performance, suggesting that task disparagement arises from stereotype threat and does not simply reflect reactions to poor performance."

Individuals then were randomly assigned to receive an explicit external attribution for success in the upcoming memory task (that light exposure will help their memory), an explicit internal attribution for success (that they were in a placebo condition so their memory success will be due to their effort) or no feedback. Results showed that memory performance varied as a function of subliminal presentation of age-related stereotypes but not as a function of explicit attributions. When negative stereotypes were made accessible, even without participants' conscious awareness, memory performance generally suffered. Memory improved with unconscious exposure to positive aging stereotypes. In Experiment 2, men and women between 18-35 years of age (average = 26) generally showed few effects of subliminal exposure to the elderly stereotypes, with the exception of some increased memory performance in the negative stereotype condition. These studies suggest that even unconscious exposure to group stereotypes can introduce stereotype threat and reduced performance in individuals who identify with the group."

If stereotype threat could be established in traditionally non-stigmatized groups, it would suggest that stereotype threat is a general phenomenon that could potentially affect anyone in contexts where expectations of low performance are invoked. Female and male undergraduates completed three tasks that had been presented as an exercise to \"better understanding the cognitive factors involved in the processing of verbal information\" (control) or as a way to understand gender differences in processing affective information with the reminder that \"men are not as apt as women to deal with affect in general and specifically to process affective information as effectively\" (stereotype threat for men). The tasks involved participants deciding whether stimulus words were or were not affective in nature, were or were not positive, and were words or nonwords. Men in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition made significantly more errors on the affective discrimination task, but their performance on the other two tasks did not differ. Women showed no differences in performance in the two conditions on any task. Stereotype endorsement did not mediate the effects, but identification with the threatened domain (reflected in responses to questions about the importance of processing affective information in everyday life and in the professional life of a psychologist) predicted decrements in performance under threat. These data show that a chronic lower status or a history of stigmatization are not preconditions of stereotype threat, but that stereotype threat can occur for any group member who identifies with the domain in question."

In Experiment 1, Black and White undergraduates were told they were to take a test that either \"may be biased against people belonging to certain ethnic and/or racial groups\" (stereotype threat for Blacks) or \"is culturally unbiased...the scores are a true test of intelligence, regardless of ethnic background\" (control). The students then completed either an easy or a difficult task involving word associations. Based on whether they had been given the easy or difficult task, students were told that they had done well above average or well below average, respectively. The students' performance self-esteem measured after they had received feedback was the primary dependent measure. Results showed that Whites reactions to the feedback were more extreme; compared with Black students, they felt better after positive feedback and thought they actually performed better but felt worse and thought they had performed worse after negative feedback. Although these results were consistent with the hypothesis that Black's self-esteem can become decoupled from academic performance, it was surprising that the stereotype threat manipulation did not moderate this effect. Experiment 2 addressed the possibility that the mere mentioning of race in both conditions of Experiment 1 might have primed racial stereotypes, inducing threat in both conditions. To do so, Black and White undergraduates who varied in their pre-existing levels of identification with academics completed the difficult test from Experiment 1 either to \"determine whether [it] is racially biased against certain minority groups\" (stereotype threat for Blacks) or to \"gather more information on this important test\" (control). Although all students were told they had done poorly, the affect of that feedback on self-esteem varied by race and stereotype threat condition. Under stereotype threat, Black's self-esteem was higher than for Whites after failure feedback. In the control condition, however, failure feedback caused Blacks to exhibit lower self-esteem than Whites. The consequences of feedback were also somewhat moderated by chronic disengagement from academics among Black, but not White, students. The findings confirm that African-American self-esteem tends to be disengaged from academic performance, particularly in conditions that highlight the potential role of racial bias in accounting for poor performance."

An additional condition allowed some women who had been exposed to stereotype threat to affirm an important characteristic they possessed by writing about a time that it had been important to them. Men's math performance was not affected by the stereotype threat manipulation, but women's performance was worse in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. However, women who had self-affirmed under stereotype threat performed as well as women in the control condition. In Experiment 2, male and female undergraduates were asked to complete a task involving spatial rotation after informing them that stereotypes suggest that women \"have more trouble with spatial rotation tasks.\" Half the students were given a self-affirmation task and the others were not. Performance of men on the task was unaffected by the self-affirmation manipulation, but women performed more poorly than men without affirmation but performed equally well after they were allowed to self-affirm.

The test administrator was either Black or White, and the administrator's competence in the verbal domain was established through several means. Black students performed worse when the test administrator was White than when Black, and their performance was as good as White students when the administrator was Black. Whites were unaffected by the administrator's race. In addition, Blacks reported more stereotype threat in the White compared with the Black test administrator condition, and reported threat partially mediated the relation between administrator race and test performance. These results suggest that providing ingroup role models can reduce stereotype threat and attenuate performance decrements that typically occur in such conditions."

    "annotation": "This study used a large national sample to investigate the impact of Barack Obama's campaign and election on racial differences in test performance under stereotype threat. Samples of Black and White adults who had volunteered to complete a series of web-based experiments were contacted at four points during 2008: i) just prior to the Democratic National Convention (Aug 22-24), ii) in the days following Obama's nomination acceptance speech (Aug 28-Sept 2), iii) midway between the convention and the general election (Oct 1-4), and iv) in the days following Obama's election (Nov 5-7). At these times, participants completed a difficult verbal exam using items drawn from the GRE. To induce stereotype threat amongst African-Americans, all participants were told that the exam was useful for diagnosing their intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Results showed that White participants performed better than African-American participants at times when Obama's successes were less salient (Times 1 & 3). However, the performance of Black and White participants did not differ significantly immediately after the election (Time 4). In addition, Black and White participants' who watched Obama's acceptance speech (Time 3) did not differ significantly, but Whites performed better than Blacks who had not seen the speech. These results show that the successes of an African-American role model can attenuate performance decrements that typically emerge under stereotype threat, and the degree of attenuation appear to be calibrated with the magnitude of Obama's accomplishments and corresponding positive media coverage. Consistent with other findings (Aronson, Jannone, McGlone, & Johnson-Campbell, in press), these results demonstrate that real-world role models, such as Obama, can trump racial stereotypes, but only when their success and accomplishments are especially salient to fellow ingroup members. A focus on Obama eliminated typical stereotype threat effects only at those times when considerable media attention was drawn to his stereotype-defying accomplishments and not at times when less attention was drawn to his race, associated stereotypes, and his achievements."

    "annotation": "This paper reports three experiments examining the attenuation of stereotype threat when women are provided with role models who suggest suggest competence. Experiment 1 involved highly math-identified male and female students who were given a difficult, diagnostic math test by one of three male or female experimenters. The math competence of the experimenter was established by indicating that the experimenter had developed the test and would be providing feedback on the students performance. Women performed as well as men when the test was administered by a woman, but they performed more poorly (and showed lower state self-esteem) when the test had been administered by a man. In Experiment 2, all participants were led to believe that they would interact with a female experimenter, but there was no experimenter physically present during testing. In addition, the description of the experimenter was varied to suggest either high or low competence in math. Women performed more poorly with a low-competence experimenter, but men actually performed better when they thought the experimenter was low in competence. When the experimenter was supposedly high in competence, men and women showed equivalent performance. In Experiment 3, female students were led to believe that they would interact with either a high- or low-competence female experimenter. Women in the high-competence experimenter condition performed better on the test, had elevated appraisals of their own math ability, and showed higher levels of state self esteem compared with women in the low-competence experimenter condition. These studies show that providing a role model who challenges stereotypic assumptions about mathematical ability can eliminate stereotype threat effects in that domain."

Various emotions were measured both before and after individuals took a test under either the presence or absence of stereotype threat. For those students operating under stereotype threat, heightened anxiety was experienced before taking the test and heightened frustration occurred after the test was concluded. Frustration correlated negatively with performance in the threat condition, such that higher levels of frustration were associated with poorer test performance. Surprisingly, feelings of anxiety were unrelated to performance on the test. No changes in emotions were exhibited by individuals not under stereotype threat. This study shows that stereotype threat does produce emotional consequences and that these emotions change over time."

    "annotation": "These studies showed the different consequences of group priming (highlighting a social category) and stereotype threat (highlighting a social identity). Whereas group priming tends to affect behavior in a stereotype-consistent fashion, stereotype threat appears to affect only individuals whose social identities are tied to the stereotype. According to this view, the relevance of the stereotype to the self is necessary for stereotype threat. Highlighting any stereotype can produce stereotype-consistent behavior, but the stereotype must be self-relevant to create stereotype threat. To test this idea, male and female undergraduates in Experiment 1 completed a math test that was described as \"diagnostic of ability\" (stereotype threat for women) or \"a reasoning exercise\" (control). Half also completed a sentence-unscrambling task to prime the trait \"dumb\" whereas the other half completed the task with filler stimuli designed not to raise the accessibility of intelligence-related constructs. In the stereotype threat conditions, females performed more poorly on the test than did males, consistent with other studies on stereotype threat. In control conditions, however, performance was affected only by whether \"dumb\" had been primed; performance was lower for both men and women when words denoting lack of intelligence rather than filler stimuli comprised the sentence descrambling task. In Experiment 2, men and women completed a task described either as reflecting \"emotional sensitivity\" (stereotype threat for men) or as an \"emotional exercise\" (control). Participants had been primed with either words related to emotional insensitivity or filler words. Results replicated those of Experiment 1, with the gender group under stereotype threat (men) performing more poorly in the diagnostic condition, but with both gender groups performing more poorly when insensitivity had been primed. Experiment 3 involved male and female participants taking a math test under one of four conditions. In one condition, the accessibility of participants\u2019 social self was increased before they took a nonthreatening math test. In a second condition, participants were primed with stereotypic traits before taking a nonthreatening math test. In the third condition, participants completed a test described as diagnostic of math ability, and the fourth condition involved participants taking a nonthreatening test. Underperformance occurred when the stereotype was relevant to the social self (either because the test was diagnostic or because the self was made accessible). However, when the test was nonthreatening and the self was not implicated, participants were affected by the prime, with stereotypic traits producing underperformance. Thus, stereotype threat is separable from priming effects. Stereotype threat is a predicament that arises in situations where one\u2019s performance is linked to a concern about confirming negative stereotypes about one's group."

    "annotation": "This article examines the role of collective identity (i.e., when thoughts about one's social groups are prominent in one's thoughts) in stereotype threat. It was reasoned that if stereotype threat affects performance by increasing the prominence or accessibility of a group-based stereotype, then the accessibility of stereotype-relevant group memberships should be higher in settings in which a stereotype might apply than in situations in which it could not. Experiment 1 tested this notion by leading male and female undergraduates to expect that they would complete a math test that was described either as \"diagnostic of math ability\" (stereotype threat for women) or as a \"reasoning exercise\" (control). Before taking the supposed math test, students completed a \"reading comprehension\" exercise in which they were asked to list group-based pronouns (e.g., \"we,\" \"us\") that had been underlined in a written passage. Consistent with predictions, women under stereotype threat produced more group-based pronouns than did women in the control condition. Men listed fewer pronouns than women in the threat condition, and their number of listings did not vary by condition. These results confirmed the hypothesis that collective social identities become highlighted by stereotype threat. Experiment 2 used a similar method but just with female undergraduates to assess the kinds of social identities that are highlighted by stereotype threat. Stereotype threat increased the accessibility of women's gender category but not other categories that were irrelevant to the stereotype (e.g., friend, family member, student). Moreover, the degree of gender identification was negatively related to performance expectations for the upcoming math test. In Experiment 3, female undergraduates in the stereotype threat or in the control condition read a fictitious newspaper article that described a female student who either excelled in math or did less well in math. One-third of the students did not receive any information about another student (control). When the test was described as diagnostic of ability (and gender identity was presumably most accessible), women were strongly affected by whether they had been exposed to a positive role model. Their expectations of academic success were higher, their concerns about others' evaluations were lower, and their actual math performance was better than when they had been exposed to a less impressive role model. Moreover, these effects were generally reversed in the nondiagnostic condition, where social identities would not have been accessible, showing that role models can actually reduce expectations and performance if a shared social identity is not obvious or highlighted. Experiment 4 extended this research by providing female students with a role model demonstrating excellence in math or an unrelated domain (sports). Role models only improved expectations of success and actual performance if they demonstrated excellence in the relevant domain of math. These studies point to the important role of accessible collective identities in stereotype threat and highlight that role models can eliminate performance decrements under threat (and, in fact, can improve performance) when they are viewed as sharing a collective identity with a person under threat."

In this experiment, Black and White undergraduates were told they would take a test frequently used in professional personnel selection. The test was actually the APM, which was described either as assessing intelligence (stereotype threat for Blacks) or perceptual ability (control). Measures included test performance, general stereotype threat (the degree that individuals believe society views their group in terms of a negative stereotype), and specific stereotype threat ( the degree that individuals are concerned with doing well in a specific situation). Although Blacks reported more general stereotype threat and more specific stereotype threat than Whites in the threat condition, test performance did not reflect stereotype threat performance decrements; overall, Blacks performed more poorly than Whites, regardless of the task description. Manipulation check data indicate that Blacks showed some stereotype threat even in the control condition. Thus, it appears that stereotype threat might account for Black's overall lower performance (see Brown & Day, 2006). These data also point to the benefit of distinguishing general from specific forms of stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "This study examined whether stereotype threat might be less likely in situations where there are incentives for strong performance. In addition, the study was designed to determine if stereotype threat might also affect performance on a test irrelevant to the domain in question. To address these issues, Black and White undergraduates were told that the study examined performance on two different types of tests and that high performers across both tests would receive a monetary reward. Half the students completed a racial identity scale and a demographic form before taking the tests and were told that tests were good indicators of intelligence and ability (stereotype threat for Blacks regarding cognitive ability). The other half of students were told they were completing a personality and problem solving test, and their racial and demographic information was collected at the end of the study (control). The order of completing the cognitive ability and personality tests was also manipulated. Analysis of the performance on the cognitive ability test showed that Black students performed less well on the test than did Whites, but there were no affects of the threat manipulation. Whites who identified with the domain performed better on the cognitive ability test than those who did not, but there was no relationship between domain identity and performance for Blacks. Different effects emerged from analyses focusing on racial identity, depending on when racial identity was assessed. Blacks scoring high in racial identity before the test performed better on the cognitive ability test than those who were low in racial identity. In contrast, Blacks high in identity on a measure completed after the test performed worse than those Blacks low in racial identity. It appears that a strong racial identity aids in performance, but good performance can ironically decrease racial identity. Consistent with this interpretation is the finding that Black students who showed the biggest decrease in racial identity from the beginning to the end of the experiment performed best on the test. Thus, effective testing performance might result in (or even require) disidentification over the course of testing. On the personality test, individuals performed better in the threat compared with the control condition, and this effect was stronger for Black than for White students. Overall, these findings point to a relatively small role of stereotype threat when external incentives for performance are established. In such conditions, performance depends on both domain identity and racial identity. In addition, this study shows that stereotype threat can actually increase performance on tasks unrelated to the stereotype."

Male and female undergraduates completed the the Vandenberg Mental Rotation Test (VMRT), a standard test of visual\u2013spatial ability. Before taking the test, students completed questionnaires designed to highlight different aspects of their social identities that should differentially be associated with stereotypical gender differences in spatial abilities. One questionnaire highlighted gender identity, containing items that made reference to students' sex or gender (stereotype threat for women). A second questionnaire highlighted participants' status as students at a private school. A third questionnaire made salient students' status as residents of the Northeast. The effects of these different highlighted identities differed for males and females. For females, performance was worst when gender was made salient but best when college identity was highlighted. For men, their performance was best when their gender was highlighted but worst when their Northeast citizen identity was made salient. Consistent with other studies on stereotype threat, the difference in performance between males and females was greatest when gender was made salient. These results show that highlighting social identities with differing implications for spatial ability can moderate performance on spatial tasks."

Women performed worse then men when they read no essays about successful women, but there was no significant difference in performance if women read even just one essay about a successful woman. Women's performance did improve as the number of read essays increased, but to a lesser degree with each unit increase. Men's performance was not influenced by the numbers of essays read.

Performance on the math task varied as a function of gender and exposure to positive role models. Women in the control condition performed worse than women exposed to positive role models, but men performed no differently in the two conditions. Both studies suggest that performance decrements under gender stereotype threat in mathematics can be reduced by reminding women of other women's accomplishments."

The analysis of APM performance showed that Whites outperformed Blacks overall, but a marginally significant interaction showed that the difference in performance was somewhat greater in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition.

The lack of a significant interaction may reflect the fact that the biographical form completed before the APM inquired about participants' age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status.

As children become aware that other individuals might believe in and use stereotypes, susceptibility to stereotype threat might increase.

Results showed that awareness of other's stereotypes increased dramatically between six and ten years of age. A similar effect was found for awareness of cultural stereotypes, but stigmatized children showed greater awareness of these stereotypes at every age. In Experiment 2, the same children who participated in the first experiment were asked to complete two tasks: one involved writing letters backward under limited time, and a second involved identifying which one of four words did not belong with the others. The tests were described as being either diagnostic of ability (stereotype threat for members of stigmatized groups) or not diagnostic of ability (control). Performance on the writing task, but not the word puzzle, was affected by stigma status, test description, and awareness of cultural stereotypes. For children aware of stereotypes, performance was lower for the children with stigmatized ethnicities than for children with nonstigmatized ethnicities but only when the test was described as diagnostic. There were no differences in performance between these groups of children when the test was described as nondiagnostic of ability. These results indicate that awareness of broadly held stereotypes is a precondition for stereotype threat effects and also show that this awareness, and hence vulnerability, increases with age"

The gender composition of the discussants was varied so that either 75% of the discussants were males (reflecting approximate sex differences in obtaining degrees in these fields in the U.S.) or males and females each represented 50% of the discussants. Physiological measures of arousal were collected while the students watched the videotape, and, later, memory for details in the video and in the experimental setting was assessed. In terms of memory performance, women who viewed the video comprised mostly of men recalled more details about the video and showed greater recall of science and math items that had been present in the experimental setting. Woman in this condition also showed greater skin conductance, decreases in heartbeat intervals, and greater sympathetic activation of the cardiovascular system than did women who watched a gender-balanced video. These women also reported that they would feel less comfortable attending the conference and would be less likely to do so compared with women who watched the sex-balanced discussion. Men did not differ on any of these measures as a function of the video they watched, although they did report greater interest in attending the conference if it was represented as gender-balanced. These results suggest that expected minority status is sufficient to produce stereotype threat as reflected in attentive vigilance, physiological arousal, and a reduced sense of belonging."

In Experiment 1, Italian boys and girls in grades 2-5 (approximately 6-11 years of age) answered questions designed to assess their beliefs and opinions about mathematics. Approximately two weeks later, the children completed a math test after reading vignettes either about 9 famous male and 1 famous female mathematician (stereotype threat for girls) or vignettes about 10 neutral stimuli (control). Analysis of attitudes towards math showed that boys and girls showed similar levels of self-confidence in second and third grade, but boys showed higher self-confidence than girls in both fourth and fifth grade. In terms of stereotype endorsement, boys and girls had different beliefs at different ages. The youngest boys rated boys and girls as equal skilled in math, but boys rated boys as better than girls in math at every other age. The youngest girls believed girls to be better in math than boys. However, girl's ratings changed with age so that they were more likely to agreed with the stereotype that boys are better than girls in mathematics. In terms of math performance, there were no effects of condition for children in grades 2-4. In grade 5, however, boys performed better than girls, and girls performed somewhat worse in the stereotype threat condition than in the control condition. In Experiment 2, boys and girls from grades 3 (average age = 8.2), 5 (10.2), and 8 (13.0) completed procedures very similar to the one used in Experiment 1. Self-confidence in math was higher for boys than girls in third grade, but not significantly different in grades five or eight. Regarding stereotype endorsement, third grade and fifth grade boys thought that boys were better than girls in math, but girls showed no difference in their estimates. There were no differences between boy's and girl's estimates in eighth grade. Analysis of math performance showed that girls performed as well as boys except in eighth grade. In that grade, girls in the stereotype threat condition performed worse than girls in the control condition. Eighth grade boys did not differ in their performance between conditions. These results show that girls evaluate themselves less confidently in mathematics despite exhibiting equal performance, and that boys endorse gender stereotypes in math to a greater degree than girls. Girls show a progressive shift from ingroup favoritism to more stereotypical beliefs. Performance deficits under stereotype threat emerged only in the oldest groups in each study, although the age of those two groups differed."

    "annotation": "This experiment examined whether stereotype threat effects would emerge in a real classroom setting. To see if they would, French children in the 3rd grade (7-8 years of age) were asked to color drawings of a boy or a girl with a ball, respectively (to highlight self-gender) or a landscape (control) then to complete a set of difficult and easy math problems. Results showed that girls performed less well on the difficult items when their gender had been highlighted compared to the control condition. Boys' performance on difficult items was unaffected by the coloring task. Performance on the easier items did not differ by condition, though girls showed a slight tendency to perform better when their gender was highlighted. These results show that stereotype threat effects can occur in young children in a realistic setting but that these effects emerged only on difficult and challenging items."

Although the meta-analysis showed that both minorities and women were susceptible to stereotype threat, decrements in performance on difficult tests were larger for minorities than for women. For minorities, stereotype threat effects were largest when cues signaling stereotype threat were moderately explicit; women performed most poorly when gender was subtly highlighted. Women who were moderately identified with a domain such a mathematics were most susceptible to performance decrements under stereotype threat, and effects for highly-identified women were weaker but significant. These results show that stereotype threat effects are reliable but also moderated by several factors."

    "annotation": "This experiment explored the possible mediating roles of cognition, motivation, and emotionality in performance on a cognitive ability test collected under the guise of a job application exercise. Black and White college undergraduates participated in a study that was supposedly \"to examine the extent to which perceived job desirability would influence job applicants\u2019 selection test performance.\" A monetary award was promised for excellent performance. All participants also completed a demographic questionnaire indicating their gender, age, year in college, major, cumulative GPA, and ACT or SAT scores. Two methods were used to induce stereotype threat. Before filling out the demographic questionnaire, some students were were told that the personnel selection test was difficult and \"will give the employer a genuine diagnostic evaluation of your Math, Verbal, and Logical reasoning abilities and limitations.\" They were also asked to provide their racial identity on the demographic form (stereotype threat for Blacks). Students in the other condition were told only that they were to take a selection test, and they indicated their race at the end of the study (control). All students then completed a test of cognitive ability with three subtests of logical, mathematical, and verbal reasoning. Manipulation checks focusing on anxiety experienced during the test indicated that Blacks were more anxious in the stereotype threat than the control condition, but Whites did not differ across the two conditions. Despite this evidence that Blacks experienced stereotype threat, no stereotype threat decrements in performance were obtained. Instead, Whites tended to perform better than Blacks in all conditions. However, Blacks in the stereotype threat condition performed better on the Math subtest to the degree that they were better in utilizing test-taking strategies than when they were not. In addition, Blacks under stereotype threat performed worse to the degree that they attended to distracting stimuli. The negative affects of distraction were weaker for Blacks in the control condition. Although this study did not replicate standard stereotype threat effects (perhaps because the pre-test demographic forms inadvertently highlighted race across the board or because an incentive was provided for excellent performance (see McFarland, Lev-Arey, & Ziegert, 2003)), it does show that different strategies and differing levels of distractibility can occur under stereotype threat that affect performance."

If individuals under stereotype threat distance themselves from a task to reduce the implications of task performance for self-evaluation, motivation might not be undermined. This study tested for this temporary defensive response by having White and Black students complete a difficult anagram task that was described as \"not a diagnostic test [but] an activity we use as a warm-up for problem solving exercises\" (no threat) or as \"diagnostic of academic ability, much like other similar tests such as the GRE, the MCAT, or the LSAT\" (stereotype threat for Black students). After an experimenter graded their anagram performance in front of them, the students were asked to estimate how many anagram or verbal analogy problems they would like to attempt in an upcoming exercise. Overall performance on the anagram task was poor, and there we no differences based on race or threat condition. However, Black students in the stereotype threat condition were more likely to express an interest in persisting on anagrams in the second task compared with the other three conditions. In addition, these individuals were most likely to disengage from the task by indicating that they did not care what the test implied about their ability. Mediational analyses suggested that disengagement accounted for the relation between race, stereotype threat, and persistence. These findings suggest that disengagement can maintain persistence and motivation for individuals under stereotype threat following failure when a test is viewed as diagnostic and where future performance might serve to discredit stereotypes or to compensate for failure. Of course, short-term disengagement might preserve motivation even though long-term disengagement tends to produce more negative consequences."

Male and female students were told they would complete a series of math tests that either have shown gender differences (stereotype threat for women) or have not shown gender differences (control). The difficulty of the tests were varied so that half of the participants completed an easy set of math problems and the other half completed a set of difficult problems. Stereotype threat improved performance of women on the easy set of problems but harmed performance on the difficult item set. Men were unaffected by the stereotype threat manipulation. These results are compatible with accounts of stereotype threat that point to a central role for arousal."

This phenomenon, termed disidentification, suggests that African-Americans begin with strong identity attachments to academics but are increasingly likely to detach their self-esteem from such pursuits over time. To test these hypotheses, data regarding African-American and White students' self-esteem and GPA in 8th and 10th grades were drawn from the National Education Longitudinal Study. In 8th grade, African-American and White students had statistically equivalent GPAs, but GPAs differed significantly by 10th grade. Black students, however, had higher self-esteem than White students in both 8th and 10th grades. The strength of the relation between GPA and self-esteem changed over time and differed somewhat by student sex. For African-American boys, the correlation between GPA and self-esteem decreased significantly between 8th and 10th grades, but the correlation increased for White boys. African-Americans girls showed a similar, but not a statistically significant, decreased association, whereas White girls showed no change over time. These results are all consistent with the notion that African-Americans, and particularly African-American boys, tend to disidentify from academics over time. Although disidentification can serve to protect self-esteem, it can also undermine motivation and performance in academic domains."

Results showed that Whites had higher GPAs at each grade level and GPAs that were statistically equivalent across grades. GPAs for Hispanic students dropped across grade levels, and GPAs for African-American students showed that pattern even more strongly. However, Blacks had higher self-esteem at all three grade levels, and Hispanics had the lowest self-esteem in 8th grade but self-esteem higher than White students by 12th grade. The correlation between GPA and self-esteem was significant for all groups in 8th grade, but African-American boys showed a weakening correlation over time so that by 12th grade, GPA and self-esteem were not significantly related. There was some evidence of weakening correlations in Hispanic males between 8th and 12th grades, particularly in the domain of reading. These findings offer additional evidence that African-American boys tend to disidentify from academics over time."

The database also included students self-reports of anxiety they experienced when taking the tests. Results showed that whites tended to outperform blacks on these tests and also experienced less anxiety when taking them. Statistically controlling for anxiety reduced the strength of the relation between race and test performance. Similarly, boys reported lower levels of anxiety and outperformed girls in mathematics, and statistically controlling for anxiety reduced the gender-performance link. This correlational study with a large real-world sample suggests that anxiety might help account for reduced performance under conditions that typically produce stereotype threat in controlled laboratory settings."

While students completed the math test, measures of heart rate, skin conductance, and skin surface temperature were recorded, as was time spent on each math item. Results showed that men outperformed women in both conditions. However, only women in the stereotype threat condition took longer to answer each item, suggesting a higher degree of cognitive disruption. Moreover, only women in the stereotype threat condition exhibited greater skin conductance and decreased skin temperature over the course of the study, both of which suggest anxiety and autonomic arousal. These data suggest that increased physiological arousal might cause or coincide with cognitive disruptions under stereotype threat."

Among students of color, however, those who most identified with academics were most likely to withdraw from school. Academic identification did not significantly affect withdrawal rates among white students. This finding lends support to the counterintuitive notion that the individuals most at risk for withdrawing from school are those operating under the stigma of low expectations combined with a high investment in schooling."

Female undergraduates entered a laboratory in which, in one condition, there hung a cartoon depicting a woman struggling to answer an easy math problem while a man solves a difficult math problem (stereotype threat for women). In the other condition, there was no cartoon on the wall (control). Students were told that they would complete a difficult math test after being told either \"males and females do equally well on this test\" or nothing about gender differences. Most women in the stereotype threat condition later reported noticing the cartoon and those that did reported feeling some emotional reaction. Despite these reported reactions, most women did not believe that seeing the cartoon affected their math performance. Math performance was affected, however, although in an unexpected fashion. In the condition in which women were exposed to the hostile cartoon, women who were told nothing about gender differences on the test did better than women told that men and women perform equally. In contrast, women in the control condition exhibited a pattern consistent with classic stereotype threat effects, with women performing marginally better when assured of no gender differences. These results suggest that exposing women to gender-consistent stereotypes does not always undermine performance. In this study, where the stereotypical message was delivered through a derogatory cartoon, women seemed to react in opposition to the message, increasing motivation and performance on the task."

Before beginning the test, students were told that it was diagnostic of intelligence (stereotype threat for Blacks), a good indicator of \"skills as a retail manager\" (non-diagnostic), or that the test was difficult (control). The test itself was either high or low in face validity (i.e., problems were either framed in terms that would be appropriate for a retail manager or were framed in a way where the link to retail management was tenuous). Overall, performance was higher for Whites than for Blacks, and higher in the control than in the diagnostic condition. Race did not interaction with diagnosticity, as would be predicted by stereotype threat theory. However, an analysis focusing only students highly identified with their race did produce an effect consistent with stereotype threat. Specifically, Blacks scored best in the control condition when the test was low in face validity. When the test was high in face validity, however, Blacks scored best in the non-diagnostic condition. When the test was low in face validity and students were told just that the test was difficult, performance of Black students as good as Whites. When the test was high in face validity, however, Blacks performed best if intelligence was not mentioned. These findings suggest that Blacks might assume that face valid tests are diagnostic unless they are assured to the contrary. Correlational analyses indicated that differences in perceptions of threat influence face validity perceptions, motivation, and anxiety, and these factors partially mediated performance under stereotype threat."

Bifurcation was theorized as a mechanism by which women might resolve the tension between their gender identity and their identification with a given domain when poor performance might be expected based on their gender. Results confirmed that women alter their self-descriptions in response to stereotype threat. Experiment 1 was a correlational study demonstrating that to the degree women had completed a large number of quantitative courses, they were less likely to describe themselves with gender stereotypes seen as problematic or incongruent for women in mathematics (e.g., flirtatious, emotional). Endorsement of gender stereotypes seen as less relevant to math (e.g., sensitive, empathetic) were not affected by math experience, as were endorsement of male's self-descriptions. Experiments 2 and 3 involved women high- or low-identified in math either reading an article agreeing with gender stereotypes in mathematical ability and completed a personality survey (stereotype threat condition), reading a story about aging and completed the survey (control condition, Study 2) or simply completing the survey (control condition, Experiment 3). In both studies, women who identified with math were less likely to use math-relevant gender stereotypes to describe themselves than did women not under stereotype threat or compared with women not identified with math. These studies show that women who experience stereotype threat may emphasize stereotypical traits that pose less of an obstacle for success compared with traits that are seen as incompatible with success in the domain in question."

In Experiment 1, participants were undergraduates who either had or had not previously received treatment for a mental illness. All students completed a test based on the Analytic portion of the GRE. Before starting the test, however, half of the students were asked questions designed to reveal their mental health history and were told that the test was diagnostic of their ability (stereotype threat for individuals with a history of mental illness) or did not answer such questions and were told that the test was not diagnostic of ability (control). The poorest test performance was exhibited by individuals with a history of mental illness who were prompted to reveal this history. In Experiment 2, female students who did or did not have a history of depression were either prompted to reveal or did not have to reveal this history. After doing so, all participants completed two tests, one of which supposedly was diagnostic of ability and one which was not. As in Experiment 1, having to reveal a history of mental illness reduced performance on a diagnostic test. Performance on the supposed nondiagnostic test was also negatively affected, though to a lesser degree. Experiment 3 focused on whether revealing any stigmatized condition would harm performance. Female undergraduates with a history of mental illness, a history of an eating disorder, or no history of either mental illness or eating disorder were either prompted to reveal their history or not before completing an intellectual test. Only women with a prior history of mental illness performed more poorly on the test after revealing their history. These results show that revealing a stigma associated with mental incompetence can undermine task performance."

When the word problems were presented in their basic numeric form, however, performance was equivalent. In Experiment 2, male and female students attempted to solve the same difficult math problems but did so either in standard conditions (where there exists a stereotype of male superiority in math) or a control condition where, participants were told, \"men and women perform equally well on these problems.\" Problem-solving strategies were assessed by having students speak aloud and take notes as they attempted to answer math problems. Women were less effective than men at formulating strategies but only in the standard (i.e., stereotype threat) condition. These results suggest that individuals operating under stereotype threat can experience difficulty formulating and utilizing task-relevant cognitions that assist in solving problems."

Stereotype threat also predicted feedback discounting, so that African-Americans who experienced stereotype threat were more likely to dismiss feedback they received, to doubt its accuracy, and to question the motivations of the feedback source.

The dependent variable involved individuals indicating their interest in pursuing eight different careers, four of which pilot tests showed were strongly (mechanical engineer, military officer) or weakly (dentist, accountant) stereotypical for men and four of which were strongly (registered nurse, primary school teacher) or weakly (physical therapist, social worker) stereotypical for women. Results showed that females in the control condition preferred stereotypically female careers compared with male careers. This difference was still significant, but also significantly weaker, in the overlap condition. In Experiment 2, women undergraduates were randomly assigned to complete the category overlap task from Experiment 1, a category difference task in which they were to \"think of five things that can distinguish men from women,\" or completed no task prior to completing a series of math story problems. Math performance was better in the category overlap than in the control or category difference conditions, and performance did not differ significantly in the latter two conditions. In Experiment 3, women undergraduates were assigned to one of four conditions. One condition replicated the control conditions of Experiments 1 and 2, a second condition involved informing students that their results would be compared with men, a third condition involved the category overlap task followed by the threat manipulation, and the fourth condition in which the category overlap task and threat manipulation were reversed. Math performance did not differ in the control versus the condition in which results were to be compared with men, suggesting that the control condition had implicated stereotype threat in the previous studies. Performance was no better in the condition in which the threat manipulation preceded the category overlap task. However, performance was significantly better in the condition in which the category overlap task preceded the threat manipulation. Thus, it appears that identifying commonalities between groups might cause stereotype threat not to form in conditions where it otherwise might."

    "annotation": "Two experiments tested whether emphasizing similarities between groups might reduce the harm of stereotype threat by changing performance expectancies. In Experiment 1, male and female university students were asked to generate similarities between men's and women's physical attributes, academic characteristics, or non-academic characteristics or were not asked to generate any similarities (control). Students were then asked to imagine that they were the only (man/woman) in a class of eight other (women/men) and that they had to take a (Math vs. English) exam, and they had to estimate how well they and their fellow students would do on the exam. Results showed that there were no theoretically significant effects in the domain of English. However, in the Math domain, women who generated similarities regarding academic characteristics of men and women had higher performance expectancies compared with the other conditions. In the other conditions women, but not men, expected to perform more poorly than the other students. Experiment 2 assessed performance expectations and actual performance of women in the domain of math. After completing the similarity exercise from Experiment 1, students were told that they would take a math exam and that their results would be compared with those from a group of other male students. Expectations were highest in the shared academic characteristics condition, and performance was best in the shared academic characteristics condition and marginally better in the non-academic characteristics condition compared with the other two conditions. A mediation analysis suggested that performance expectations partially accounted for the relation between condition and performance. Specifically, generating similarities between men and women in academic settings raised performance expectations which in turn improved actual performance of female students."

    "annotation": "Four experiments assessed how highlighting multiple identities with divergent implications for task performance can affect stereotype threat effects. In Experiment 1, female undergraduates completed a math test after receiving information highlighting their gender (stereotype threat), their status as a college student (a group that stereotypically is good at math), both group memberships (multiple identity), or no information about their social identities (control). Math performance was poorest in the condition in which gender was highlighted, but performance in the condition where multiple identities were highlighted was equivalent with the control condition. Experiment 2 used the same procedures as Experiment 1, but identity accessibility was measured directly. Woman students in the stereotype threat condition performed most poorly on the math test, and these participants also applied gender labels more quickly to themselves than women in the other conditions. In addition, mediational analyses suggested that decrements in performance could be explained by the relative accessibility of students' gender identity; to the degree that the female identity was more accessible than the college identity, performance was negatively affected. Experiment 3 assessed working memory capacity across the different conditions. Again, women in the stereotype threat condition performed most poorly on the math test and also showed lowest working memory capacity. Lower working memory capacity appeared to account for the poorer performance of these women. In Experiment 4, a different manipulation of group identity salience was used with a group of female undergraduates before they completed a math task. Half of the participants were asked to indicate their gender on a demographic form before taking the test whereas the other participants were not asked about gender. In addition, half were asked to indicate their status as a college student and the other half were not. Those women who were asked only about their gender performed most poorly on the math test. In sum, these results show that having at least one identity suggestive of high performance in a domain can serve a protective function, if that identity is highlighted within the testing context."

Male and female university students completed a battery of personality questionnaires designed to assess Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, and a scale to assess belief in the malleability of intelligence. In addition, the students were told that the upcoming test was either diagnostic of general cognitive ability (high stereotype threat) or that it was an interest measure (low stereotype threat) and that the test was relevant to acquiring a job as postal clerk (low face validity) or as a geometry teacher (high face validity). Variables measured included test anxiety, perceptions of stereotype threat, and task performance. Students reported experiencing greater threat in the stereotype condition, and they performed more poorly. Path analyses were conducted to assess the causal relations between variables. Agreeableness predicted all measures, with higher agreeableness producing higher stereotype threat, greater anxiety, and lower test scores. Openness to Experience was the only other personality predictor of stereotype threat, with higher levels associated with greater perceived threat. Belief in the malleability of intelligence was related to cognitive ability test scores and stereotype threat belief, with belief in fixed intelligence producing greater stereotype threat and poorer performance. These results show that both individual differences in Agreeableness and beliefs about the malleability of intelligence can affect the formation and consequences of stereotype threat."

    "annotation": "This paper examines whether different kinds of self-affirmation are differentially effective in protecting individuals from stereotype threat. Specifically, three studies assessed if affirmations highlighting on one's intrinsic self-worth (focusing on valued intrinsic self-aspects, such as unconditional relationships and important personal values) might be more effective than affirmations highlighting one's extrinsic self-worth (focusing on valued extrinsic self-aspects, such as conditionally accepting relationships and imposed social standards). In Experiment 1, male and female undergraduates were randomly assigned to complete sentence fragments referring to the self to provide an intrinsic (e.g., \"being a ____ makes me feel ____\") an extrinsic (e.g., \"when I am a successful ____ I receive ____\") or no affirmation (control; e.g., \"watching television is a good way to ____\"). After completing the affirmation manipulation, students completed a task involving mental arithmetic. Students who affirmed the self engaged in less self-handicapping before beginning the math task than in the other two conditions, and those individuals performed best on the math test (although comparisons with the control condition were not statistically significant). Experiment 2 focused on female students and utilized a manipulation of stereotype threat. Women completed either the intrinsic or extrinsic self-affirmation task from Experiment 1, then they were told they would complete a \"Quantitative Examination\" that either was \"an indication of your mathematical intelligence\" (stereotype threat) or involved \"testing problems for future research\" (control). Women in the stereotype threat condition also indicated their gender before attempting the exam. Analysis of exam performance revealed that women who intrinsically self-affirmed performed better on the exam in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. However, women who extrinsically self-affirmed performed worse on the exam in the stereotype threat compared with the control condition. In Experiment 3, women who completed a task designed to provide an intrinsic or extrinsic affirmation received either positive or no feedback from a supposed evaluator. All women then completed a task that has been shown to reflect the accessibility of thoughts about rejection by others. Women who received no feedback had more thoughts about rejection if they had extrinsically self-affirmed than if they had intrinsically self-affirmed. Women who received positive feedback showed lowered accessibility of thoughts about rejection. These studies show that extrinsic self-affirmation increases concerns about rejection, augmenting the effects of threat that can arise when stereotypes are invoked. In contrast, intrinsic self-affirmation appears to lessen concerns about rejection, producing improved performance under stereotype threat."

Steele & Aronson (1995) and others had shown that individuals are more likely to show performance decrements under conditions creating stereotype threat when they strongly identify with the domain in question (e.g., women who strongly identified with the domain of mathematics). This study sought to test whether the strength of one's group identification might also play a role (e.g., women whose gender is central to their self-definition). To do so, men and women college students who varied in terms of the centrality of gender to their identity (based on their responses to a questionnaire given earlier in the semester) were recruited to answer items that were to be included in a new math test. All students were told that the researchers would be comparing each student's score against the scores of the other students. For half of the students, however, the link between their gender and their performance was highlighted. These students were told that a comparison between the performance of men and women was central to the study and that each individual's score would be used to predict the performance of men and women more generally (stereotype threat for women). In the other condition, no mention was made of gender (control). Results indicated that for women in the stereotype threat condition, those whose identity emphasized gender performed more poorly than men. Women whose gender was less central to their identity performed equivalently with men in this condition. In the control condition, however, women performed equally with men and there were no effects of gender identity. This study shows that stereotype threat effects are most common when one's identification with both the content domain and with the relevant group is highlighted in a social context."

    "annotation": "This paper reports three studies examining the role of working memory capacity in stereotype threat. Working memory capacity refers to a memory system responsible for focusing attention on task-relevant information while inhibiting task-irrelevant thoughts. Effective utilization of working memory capacity is central for successful performance on cognitive tasks, and failures in working memory had been suggested as responsible for performance decrements under stereotype threat. These studies provided the most direct test to date of the possibility that stereotype threat might diminish working memory capacity. In these studies, participants were presented to solve math problems while also keeping a set of words in memory. Later recollection of the words was used as an index of working memory capacity. If few words could be recalled, for example, that would suggest that the math problems required more working memory. Results confirmed that stereotype threat reduces working memory capacity that is at least partially responsible for performance decrements under stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with a task described as requiring \"quantitative capacity\" that might account for gender differences in math performance (stereotype threat for females) or as a task involving working memory capacity (control). Only women in the stereotype threat condition recalled significantly fewer word, indicating reduced working memory capacity. Experiment 2 showed similar effects comparing Latino and White students where stereotype threat was created by describing the task as reflecting general intelligence; only Latinos under stereotype threat showed lower word recall. Experiment 3 manipulated stereotype threat by having women solve math problems in a group of other female students (control) or as the sole woman in a group of men (stereotype threat). Working memory capacity and performance on a math task were both lower in the latter group, and the reduction on working memory capacity statistically mediated the relation between stereotype threat and math performance. These studies suggest that stereotype threat can disrupt the ability to maintain proper focus on task-relevant information."

    "annotation": "Two experiments assessed the impact of individuals' stereotype endorsement on their performance under stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, women undergraduates who were majoring in a math-related field completed a survey in which they were asked about their endorsement of stereotypes (e.g., \"In general, men may be better than women at math\"), the legitimacy of gender-based status differences (e.g., \"Differences in status between men and women are fair\"), their perceptions of their own ability, confidence, and self-esteem in math, and their intentions of continuing in the field of mathematics. Results showed that stereotype endorsement was negatively correlated with confidence, performance self-esteem, and desire to attend graduate school in the major. Analyses controlling for GPA left these results unchanged, ruling out the possibility that actual performance in the major accounted for these effects. In Experiment 2, female undergraduates from a variety of majors indicated their degree of stereotype endorsement using the same questionnaire used in Experiment 1. Later in the semester, they were asked to complete a math test that focused either on \"each individual\u2019s performance on the test...comparing their individual scores to those of other students\" (control) or on \"how women score on the test relative to men...comparing women\u2019s scores to men\u2019s scores...using each individual\u2019s score as an indicator of women\u2019s math ability\" (stereotype threat). Women in the stereotype threat condition also indicated their sex before taking the test. Performance was marginally worse under stereotype threat than in the control condition, but this effect was moderated by stereotype endorsement. Under stereotype threat, stereotype endorsement was negatively related to women\u2019s math performance. In the control condition, however, endorsement of the stereotype was positively associated with test performance. Thus, women who tended to believe in the accuracy of gender stereotypes about women\u2019s math ability tended to perform worse on a stereotype-relevant test when their gender identity was highlighted."

    "annotation": "These studies examined the possibility that exposure to different types of stereotypes might change one's regulatory focus (Higgins, 1998), thereby altering means by which an individual attempts to solve problems. Specifically, it was suggested that positive stereotypes might induce a promotion focus engendering approach or eagerness strategies, and negative stereotypes might induce a prevention focus encouraging avoidance or vigilance strategies. To test these ideas, Experiment 1 had male and female undergraduates not majoring in psychology complete a proofreading task. Before doing so, they were told either that \"psychology students usually do very well on the task whereas students majoring in other disciplines do badly\" (negative self-stereotype) or that \"psychology students usually do badly on the task whereas students majoring in other disciplines usually do very well\" (positive self-stereotype). The main dependent measure was recall of avoidance and approach behavioral descriptions from the proofread passage. Consistent with predictions, recall of approach items was higher in the positive stereotype condition, and recall of avoidance items was higher in the negative stereotype condition. Experiment 2 looked at the speed and accuracy of women's and men's performance on a verbal ability task that had been described as measuring \"verbal skills of men and women\" (stereotype threat for men) or \"verbal abilities\" (control). It was expected that women would perform the task more quickly but less accurately under the positive stereotype (indicating approach means) but that men would perform the task more slowly but with greater accuracy under the stereotype that was negative for them (indicating vigilance means). Results generally confirmed these predictions. In Experiment 3, non-psychology majors were randomly assigned to one of the conditions in Experiment 1 or to a condition in which no stereotype was invoked. Students then completed a task in which they were to quickly and accurately connect numbered dots in three different figures. Performance was fastest in the positive stereotype condition and slowest in the negative stereotype condition. However, accuracy was best in the negative stereotype condition and worst in the positive stereotype condition. Mediational analyses indicated that speed-accuracy tradeoffs could not completely account for these effects. In Experiments 4 and 5, students completed the manipulation from Experiment 1 and then completed tasks designed to measure analytic ability and creativity. Performance was significantly better on the creativity tasks in the positive stereotype conditions but better on the analytic tasks in the negative stereotype conditions. Self-reported eagerness and vigilance strategies partially mediated the affects of stereotype valence on task performance. These data suggest that negative stereotypes can induce a risk-averse, vigilant processing style, manifesting in higher performance accuracy, diminished creativity, and enhanced analytic thinking. Positive stereotypes, however, appear to induce a risky, explorative approach leading to enhanced speed and creativity but diminished analytical ability. More generally, the authors suggest that performance is typically hindered under stereotype threat because performance on tasks that are used in such studies does not rely exclusively on eager or vigilance strategies. Because most tasks require both vigilance and eagerness means for success, stereotype threat can undermine performance when primarily vigilance means are employed under negative stereotypes."

    "annotation": "Two experiments examined the role of solo status on stereotype threat. Although many field studies had suggested that performance of women and ethnic minorities was undermined in relation to their numerical minority status, most lab studies had not. These researchers suspected that these seemingly discrepant findings had emerged because field studies usually focused on minority status at the time of performance whereas lab studies had typically focused on the time of learning. To test this possibility, Experiment 1 involved male and female undergraduates exchanging information either with same- or opposite-sex groups and then being tested on their knowledge of that information in same- or opposite-sex groups. Results showed that women had a tendency to perform more poorly when their knowledge was tested in the presence of a group of men, but men did not show this effect when tested with a group of women. Interestingly, both men and women performed more poorly when they learned under solo status (i.e., when they learned with an opposite-sex group). Experiment 2 assessed whether similar effects would emerge based on ethnicity by having White and African-American female undergraduates complete the same task used in Experiment 1 but with all-female groups that varied in ethnic composition. Only African-American women were negatively affected by solo status at performance. These results show that social status interacts with solo status: stereotype threat effects at testing are more likely when solo members of low-status groups perform in the presence of high-status outgroups."

White male and female undergraduates learned math-related information that was later to be shared with a group.

After studying the information, students then were asked to take turns answering questions about the information in the presence of three men or three women. Only women performed more poorly when they were solo (i.e., reported their answers to three men) than when they non-solo (i.e., they reported their answers to women). Only women also performed more poorly when the task was described as related to math ability compared with when there were supposedly no gender differences. Although solo status appeared to reduce performance by decreasing women's expectations of success, reduced expectations did not appear to account for poorer performance under stereotype threat. These results show that solo status and stereotype threat both contribute to reduced performance of women compared with men. Women's performance was poorest when both factors were present and best when both were absent."

It was hypothesized that solo status would tend to increase collective self-construal (i.e., a self-view that one represents one's group and that one's actions might reflect on their group). In Experiment 1, White and Black college students were given information that would supposedly be used in an upcoming study they would complete with some other students. Each student was then given photographs of the other students, and the composition of these photo sets was used to manipulate solo status. In the solo status condition, White and Black students were shown three photos of either three Blacks or three Whites, respectively. In the non-solo condition, each student was shown a picture of one same-race and two other-race students. Students then completed scales designed to measure individual and collective identity. Black students endorsed collectivist over individualist self-construal in the solo compared with the nonsolo condition, but White students' responses did not differ based on solo status. Therefore, race-based collective identity was highlighted for Blacks but not for Whites under solo status. In Experiment 2, White and Black female college students individually listened over headphones to instructions regarding an upcoming task they would supposedly later complete with three other students, and solo status was again manipulated as in Experiment 1. After having an interaction with what they thought were the other students (actually, a pre-programmed computer interaction designed to simulate interpersonal interactions), participants completed measures reflecting centrality of their race to their self-identity, race reflection (i.e., belief that their performance would reflect on their race), performance apprehension (reflecting in a tendency to self-handicap by invoking with external factors to explain poor performance), and race representativeness (the degree they represented and viewed as important their racial group). Data from Black students showed that race was more central to their identity, that performance would reflect on their race, and more performance apprehension in the solo compared with the non-solo condition. White women students showed no effect of solo status. These results show that racial solo status, particularly for minorities, tends to increase the salience of racial identity, increasing vulnerability to stereotype threat in contexts where negative stereotypes might arise."

In Experiment 1, Asian-American students completed a survey about their entertainment preferences (control), one focusing on their ethnic identity without invoking stereotypes (subtle activation), or a questionnaire that asked about their beliefs regarding the commonality and validity of stereotypes associated with Asian-Americans (blatant activation). Performance on a subsequent math task was better in the subtle activation compared with the control and blatant stereotype conditions. Although one might expect better performance when a positive stereotype is invoking, these results suggest that blatant instantiation might increase pressures and thoughts related to meeting positive expectations that interfere with effective performance. In Experiment 2, Asian-American and non-Asian students were exposed either to Asian stereotypes or control words on a computer that were presented either subliminally (without conscious awareness) or supraliminally (with awareness). Asian-American students performed better on a subsequent math test if they had been exposed subliminally to stereotypes rather than to control words. However, their performance was harmed compared with the control condition if the stereotypic words were consciously detected. For non-Asians, their performance was improved compared with the control condition if the stereotypic words were presented supraliminally but not if presented subliminally. These findings suggest that group membership and the manner of stereotype activation interact to affect performance. Whereas group members for whom the stereotype is relevant exhibited assimilation to the stereotype when it was activation in a subtle fashion but contrast away from the stereotype when it was activated blatantly, groups for whom the stereotype was irrelevant showed only assimilation under blatant activation."

    "annotation": "These experiments examined stereotype threat processes in mono- versus multi-racial individuals. It was hypothesized that biracial individuals might suppress racial stereotypes in conditions in which race is salient. Experiment 1 had multiracial, White, and Minority students complete a questionnaire about attitudes concerning race. Multiracial individuals were less likely to see race as a barrier, to report that their parents emphasized race, and to believe that race can bilogically determine personality or ability, and were more comfortable pursuing intimate relationships with people of a different racial background compared with monoracial individuals. In Experiment 2, Asian-American, White, and Asian/White biracial students completed a demographic questionnaire that solicited information about their race (race salient) or a questionnaire that did not mention race (control), then completed a task in which they had to indicate which of a series of letter strings constituted words. Half the actual words were stereotypic for Asians and half were stereotype-irrelevant. Asians were faster to classify Asian-stereotypic words than were Asian/White students and White students. In Experiment 3, White, Black, Asian (monoracial), Asian/White and Black/White (biracial) students completed a quantitative test after completing one of the questionnaires from Experiment 2 that either did or did not highlight race. Asian and White students performed better when race was made salient (indicating stereotype lift), but biracial students were unaffected by the manipulation of race salience. Surprisingly, Blacks performed equally well in the two conditions. In Experiment 4, non-Asian students read an essay about the social construction of race and were asked to write an essay agreeing that race is socially constructed (agree social construction), disagreeing with the notion that race or socially constructed (disagree social construction), or to simply circle nouns and underline verbs in the essay (control). Following the essay task, students were either exposed to Asian-relevant words (Asian prime inducing stereotype threat for non-Asians) or a set of neutral words (neutral prime) and then completed the quantitative test from Experiment 3. In contrast with the other conditions, students who were instigated to disagree with the position that race is socially constructed performed more poorly in the Asian prime condition than in the neutral prime condition. Thus, emphasizing the social construction, and de-emphasizing the biological basis, of race appears to reduce vulnerability to stereotype threat. Moreover, to the degree that multiracial identity promotes the understanding that race is socially constructed, biracial individuals may be less susceptible to stereotype threat."

In Experiment 1, Asian-American undergraduates completed a math task after responding to a survey questionnaire designed to highlight ethnicity but that did not explicitly refer to stereotypes. The survey focused on students' ethnic identity, their gender identity, or neither identity. This manipulation is particularly interesting because one identity (\"woman\") is typically negatively stereotyped but the other (\"Asian\") is typically positively stereotyped in quantitative domains. Results showed that performance was best in the Asian-identity condition, moderate in the control condition, and worst in the gender-identity condition. In Experiment 2, female high school participants from Canada (where the stereotype of Asian superiority in mathematics is weaker) showed best performance in the control condition, followed by the Asian-identity condition, followed by the gender-identity condition. These studies show that a subtle highlighting of group memberships predictably increases stereotype-confirming behavior."

In Experiment 1, female Asian-American undergraduates completed a survey designed to highlight their ethnic identity, their gender identity, or their identity as a student. After completing one of the surveys, the students were told that they would complete a task assessing their verbal ability, inducing possible stereotype threat based on Asian identity and possibly stereotype lift based on female identity. Results showed that Asian women performed best in the condition in which gender had been highlighted, marginally less well in the control condition, and marginally worse still in the Asian identity condition. Performance differed significantly between the gender and ethnic identity conditions. In addition, women in the female identity condition expressed significantly more confidence in their verbal abilities compared with the other two conditions. Experiment 2 focused on identifying the default strength of race versus gender identities in Asian-American female undergraduates who were to take a test focusing on verbal ability. Procedures were identical to Experiment 1, except the students did not take a verbal test (though they had been led to believe that they would). Instead, after completing one of the surveys, they were prompted to generate descriptions of six memories from their past, three based on their gender and three based on their ethnicity. Results showed that in the control condition (when neither gender nor ethnicity had been highlighted), students were equally likely to generate a memory based on gender or ethnicity first. However, the rated positivity of the first memory was higher when it focused on gender than when it focused on ethnicity. This suggests that women recalled memories that might be adaptive given the upcoming test focused on a domain in which stereotypes favored the performance of women. These studies are consistent with other research suggesting that highlighted one of multiple social identities can affect task performance, depending on the stereotypical expectations associated with the specific salient identity."

    "annotation": "These experiments assess the impact of stereotype threat on task interest, a strong predictor of long-term persistence in a given domain. In Experiment 1, high achievement-oriented female undergraduates who had not yet selected an academic major were asked to complete an \"computing aptitude assessment tool\" that either had or had not produced results showing that men are superior to women in mathematics (stereotype threat vs. control). Some students were given an individual performance goal (\"this aptitude tool will really show what you can do\") and these students were told either to avoid poor performance (performance-avoidance goal) or to strive for positive performance (performance-approach goal). The remaining students were given either a mastery goal (\"working on the [assessment tool] will provide you with an opportunity to really learn and understand the information\") or no specific goal. After completing the tool, students were asked to indicate their interest in the task and their interest in learning more about computing. In the control conditions, expressed interest was highest when women were given no goal. Under stereotype threat, however, interest was highest under the performance-approach goal and lowest (and statistically equal) in the no goal and performance-avoidance conditions. Results for long-term interest were generally similar but not statistically significant. These results suggest that women operating under stereotype threat and no specific goal instruction might be spontaneously generating performance-avoidance goals associated with lower interest. Experiment 2 used the same procedure as Experiment 1, except a condition was added that did not mention stereotypes and no goals were assigned. Students who varied in achievement motivation completed the assessment tool and described the thoughts they experienced while performing the task. Individuals high in achievement motivation who were subjected to stereotype threat were more likely to spontaneously produce performance-avoidance related thoughts than were individuals low in achievement motivation and in the control condition. In the condition in which stereotypes were not mentioned, individuals high in achievement motivation reported a similar number of thoughts related to performance-avoidance as high achievement motivation individuals in the stereotype threat condition, indicating that stereotypes are activated math-related situations even without explicitly mentioning gender. In Experiment 3, women who were high or low in achievement orientation were randomly assigned to receive a performance-avoidance goal or a performance-approach goal before completing the assessment tool. To induce stereotype threat, all students indicated their gender on a demographic questionnaire before completing the assessment tool. The effectiveness of the goals assigned to students depended on their levels of achievement orientation. High achievement individuals showed higher interest and absorption in the task under performance-approach than under performance-avoidance goals. In contrast, women low in achievement orientation were more likely to show interest and absorption under performance-avoidance goals. These results show that the effects of stereotype threat combine with and influence achievement goal adoption, depending on achievement motivation. Goals, in turn, can then influence interest in the domain."

In Experiment 1, White female undergraduates indicated their degree of identification with math then completed what they were told was a \"new math instrument.\" One third of the participants then completed the math test (implicit stereotype threat). The other students were told that \"men are better at mathematics than women...maybe a result of biological differences\" and either that \"our own investigations [with this instrument] found similar results\" (explicit stereotype threat) or \"our results show that there are no gender differences on [this instrument]\" (stereotype nullification). After controlling for identification level, performance scores revealed that performance was equal in the implicit stereotype threat and explicit stereotype threat conditions and lower in both conditions compared with the stereotype nullification condition. Experiment 2 used procedures similar to Experiment 1, except white men were exposed to stereotypes of their poorer performance in mathematics compared with Asians. Test performance effects were similar to Experiment 1, with performance in the explicit and implicit threat conditions equal and lower than in the nullification condition. In addition, students in the nullification condition indicated that they spent more time thinking about particular exam items whereas students in the stereotype threat conditions appeared to focus more on peripheral factors in the testing situation. These studies show that explicit and more subtle instantiations of stereotype threat produce equivalent deficits in performance. Moreover, the fact that students in the nullification condition showed less distractibility is suggestive about the reasons that performance decrements occur under stereotype threat."

In Experiment 1, women and men who were highly identified with mathematics (i.e., had a history of successful performance and valued performance in math) completed an easy or difficult math exam. Performance was equivalent when the test was relatively easy, but men outperformed women when the test was difficult. In Experiment 2, all participants completed the same set of mathematical items, but they were told either that the test they would or would not produce gender differences. Women performed more poorly than men but only in the condition in which gender differences were highlighted. Experiment 3 demonstrated similar effects with a student population with more varied background in mathematics. Thus, it appears that stereotype threat can undermine performance of women in mathematics, particularly when a challenging task is confronted and when stereotypic assumptions of gender differences in performance are not specifically dismissed."

They then were told that they would complete a second test but, prior to doing so, were asked to estimate how well they would perform. In Experiment 1, participants were female students and the second task supposedly involved spatial abilities. The description of the task was systematically varied, however, such that half the participants were told that men outperform women on the task (stereotype threat) and half were told that there were no gender differences on the task (control). Students then estimated how well they expected to do on the upcoming task. In the control condition, women were more optimistic about their performance on the second task if they had received positive (compared with negative) feedback on the first task. In the stereotype threat condition, however, women showed low expected levels of performance regardless of feedback they had received after the first task. In Experiment 2, male and female students were asked to estimate how well they would perform on the second task if they performed in a group of similar or dissimilar students. Prior feedback predicted performance expectations when students thought they would work with similar others but was unrelated to expectations when students thought they would work with individuals who were different from themselves. Stereotype activation and stereotype threat appeared to undercut the gains in confidence and expectations of success that is typically provided by positive feedback."

    "annotation": "This paper raised the possibility that culturally-shared stereotypes suggesting poor performance of certain groups can, when made salient in a context involving the stereotype, disrupt performance of an individual who identifies with that group. This effect was termed stereotype threat, and the existence and consequences of stereotype threat were investigated in four experiments. Experiment 1 involved African American and White college students who took a difficult test using items from the GRE Verbal exam under one of two conditions. In the stereotype threat condition, students were told that their performance on the test would be a good indicator of their underlying intellectual abilities. In the non-threat condition, they were told that the test was simply a problem solving exercise and was not diagnostic of ability. Performance was compared in the two conditions after statistically controlling for self-reported SAT scores. African American participants performed less well than their white counterparts in the stereotype threat condition, but in the non-threat condition their performance equaled that of their white counterparts. Experiment 2 provided a replication of this effect but also showed that African Americans both completed fewer test items and had less success in correctly answering items under stereotype threat. In Experiment 3, African-American and White undergraduates completed a task that was described either as assessing or not assessing intellectual ability. When the task supposedly measured ability, African-American participants performed more poorly. In addition, they showed heightened awareness of their racial identity (by completing word fragments related to their ethnicity), more doubts about their ability (by completing word fragments related to low ability), a greater likelihood to invoke a priori excuses for poor performance (i.e., self-handicapping), a tendency to avoid racial-stereotypic preferences, and a lower likelihood of reporting their race compared with students in the low-threat condition. Experiment 4 sought to identify the conditions sufficient to activate stereotype threat by having undergraduates complete the non-threat conditions from Experiments 1 & 2. Unlike those experiments, however, students racial ethnic information was solicited from half of the students, right before they completed the test items. Results showed that performance was poorer only among African-Americans whose racial identity was made salient prior to testing. These studies established the existence of stereotype threat and provided evidence that stereotypes suggesting poor performance, when made salient in a context involving the stereotypical ability, can disrupt performance, produce doubt about one's abilities, and cause an individual to disidentify with one's ethnic group."

A representative sample of first-year and fourth-year men and women were invited to complete a survey about students' experiences and aspirations. Included were items focusing on perceived sex discrimination and stereotype threat, identification with their academic major, and the desire to change their major. Results showed that women in male-dominated majors were more likely to report gender discrimination, expected more future discrimination, and perceived more stereotype threat than did women in majors not dominated by men. Women in male-dominated majors were no less identified with the major than were men. Women in male-dominated majors, however, were more likely to indicate that they were considering changing their major. These data show that women do report greater stereotype threat to the degree that their major involves a domain that is male-dominated. In addition, women in these areas showed a greater likelihood of leaving these disciplines, consistent with the idea that stereotype threat can produce disengagement, reduced feelings of belonging, and disidentification."

Before completing the task, students were allowed to practice as long as they liked. Students who identified highly with sports practiced significantly less in the high threat compared with the low threat condition. Students who did not identify with sports showed equivalent levels of practice in the two stereotype threat conditions. In Experiment 2, White and Hispanic undergraduates were introduced to the golf task using the high stereotype threat manipulation from Experiment 1, which was assumed to create stereotype threat for Whites but not for Hispanics. In fact, Whites showed a similar effect as in Experiment 1, practicing less when they identified with sports than when they did not. Hispanics, in contrast, did not differ in their degree of practice based on sports identification level. These results show that one consequence of stereotype threat can be reduced preparation and effort. It is believed that such \"self-handicapping\" can offer psychological protection by providing an a priori explanation for failure even while undermining preparation."

In Experiment 1, participants were led to believe either that the task required natural sports ability or required athletic intelligence. Based on culturally-shared stereotypes, these descriptions should introduce stereotype threat for White and Black participants, respectively. In fact, Blacks did perform better on the task when it was described as reflecting natural sports ability than when it was based on athletic intelligence, and Whites showed the opposite pattern. Experiment 2 focused on White participants who completed the task under high (\"natural athletic ability\") or low (\"sports psychology\") stereotype threat descriptions. Again, Whites students performed more poorly when the task was believed to reflect natural ability, but this did not occur for students who indicated that athletic performance was unrelated to their self-worth. In addition, task description did not affect students if their attention had been drawn to assessing the quality of the lab in which the test was performed, indicating that distraction might undermine stereotype threat. These studies show that stereotype threat is a general phenomenon that can affect performance when a stereotype of poor performance implicates a valued social identity."

    "annotation": "This study examined the impact of subtle versus blatant presentation of stereotype threat cues. Subtle and blatant cues were hypothesized to affect performance for different reasons and to emerge on different measures. Subtle cues might cause individuals under stereotype threat to focus resources on reducing uncertainty about bias. To the degree that this causes attention to be directed away from the task, performance on skills requiring concentration and accuracy should be harmed. Blatant cues, in contrast, do not require uncertainty reduction since bias is clearly present in the environment. Performance can still be negatively affected, however, if individuals utilize strategies that disrupt proper skill execution in an attempt to avoid mistakes that might confirm a stereotype. If so, the impact of subtle versus blatant threat might be revealed on different measures. To test these ideas, female undergraduates who were novel golfers were greeted by a male or female experimenter (subtle stereotype activation) who instructed them that they would complete a task based on golf. Following this, one third of the students were told that the test identifies \"psychological factors correlated with general sports performance\" (control condition). The other students were told that the task measured \"personal factors correlated with natural athletic ability\" and half were additionally told \"there are gender differences in sports performance\" (blatant gender) and half were told \"there are racial differences in sports performance\" (blatant race). All students then completed a golf putting task in which the aim was to hit a golf ball into the smallest of three holes on an inclined surface in as few strokes as possible. In terms of the number of strokes needed to complete the putting task, students performed worse only when gender stereotypes were blatantly invoked. Analysis of accuracy on the task, as defined by the hole in which they succeeded in hitting the ball, showed only an effect of subtle stereotype activation; women were less accurate with a male compared with a female experimenter. These data suggest that blatant stereotype threat, even if the source is an ingroup member, can induce a focus on avoiding mistakes, and this focus tends to interrupt the fluid processes that assist performance. Subtle cues, in contrast, are believed to primarily create distractions that impose a cognitive load, minimizing the availability of working memory resources that are needed to concentrate on tasks requiring accuracy. These results suggest that both blatant and subtle forms of stereotype threat can affect performance, but they appear to do so for different reasons and through different mechanisms."

Given that research suggests that stereotype threat is more pronounced on difficult than easy tests (Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999), these researchers hypothesized that reducing the difficulty of items on the GRE General Test might reduce or eliminate stereotype threat effects. The sample included White and Blacks students of both genders who were college seniors or first-year graduate students and who agreed to take a computerized GRE General test and to answer some questions about the test. Students completed either the standard test (control) or a test that was comprised of items one standard deviation lower in terms of difficulty (experimental). Analysis of test performance showed that Whites performed better than Blacks and men performed better than women, and this effect was not qualified by test difficulty. Despite the lack of performance effects, White students who took the easier test did report less state anxiety, less test anxiety, higher state self-esteem, and higher effort than did those students who took the standard test. Black students taking the two tests did not differ on these measures. Women who took the easier test reported less test anxiety than those who took the standard test, but men who took the different tests did not differ on this measure. Men who took the easier test reported expending more effort than those men who took the standard test. These results failed to replicate the findings regarding test difficulty and stereotype threat obtained in lab settings."

Overall, girls performed worse than boys, and Blacks performed worse than Whites. There were no effects of soliciting race and gender information on test performance for any group. In Experiment 2, individuals who were taking the Computerized Placement Test at community colleges during a two-week period did not respond to standard questions including items about race and ethnicity before taking the exam (experimental, n = 632). Their performance was compared with the performance of students who took the test in the next two weeks under standard conditions (control, n = 709). Women performed more poorly than men in algebra, and Blacks performed generally worse than Whites. Again, there were no appreciable affects associated with soliciting social identity information on any groups. The authors suggest that the high motivation present in high-stakes testing situations might be responsible for negating stereotype threat effects. However, a more recent re-analysis of these data (Danaher & Crandall, in press) suggest that there is evidence of reduced performance based on the timing of identity solicitation, using somewhat more liberal statistical decision rules, and that these stereotype threat effects might have substantial consequences."

    "annotation": "This experiment examined whether highlighting different aspects of a stereotype might affect the consequences of stereotype activation. Specifically, it was speculated that stereotype threat regarding women's math performance might rest on the implication that women differ from men in their inherent ability in math rather than their effort. To see whether highlighting different aspects of a gender stereotype would influence performance, female undergraduates completed a difficult math test under one of three conditions. In contrast to one set of students who proceeded immediately to the test (stereotype threat control), students in the other two conditions read a supposed actual \"scientific article\" about the basis of gender differences in math performance. One article suggested that men outperform women because of innate, genetic differences (ability threat) but the other article suggested that innate ability differences had been refuted and that differences actually reflected men's increased effort and motivation (effort threat). Although students in the effort threat condition attempted fewer items, they answered a greater percentage of test items correctly compared with the control and ability threat conditions. Students in the control and ability threat conditions performed equally poorly, suggesting that ability is brought into question by math-gender stereotypes even when it is not explicitly mentioned. These results also suggest that the impact of gender stereotypes on math performance can be reduced if differences in effort rather than ability are emphasized as explanations for performance differences."

    "annotation": "This experiment measured physiological responses in different testing conditions to assess whether individuals viewed a difficult test as challenging (when resources are seen as adequate for successful task completion) or threatening (when resources are seen as inadequate for successful task completion). Whereas challenges tends to decrease systemic vascular resistance and to increase cardiac output, threat increases vascular resistance but produces minimal change in cardiac output. To examine these physiological responses to task demands, the researchers had male and female undergraduates complete a difficult math test that was described as typically producing gender differences (invoking stereotype threat for women) or no gender differences (control). Compared with baseline measures collected before the test was introduced, women under stereotype threat exhibited physiological responses consistent with threat, but women who believed that the test was unbiased showed patterns consistent with challenge. In contrast, men exhibited challenge patterns when the test was described as biased (i.e., when the test supposedly favored males), but they showed threat responses when the test was unbiased. These findings suggest that stereotype threat can lead women to view math-related tests as posing a threat in that available resources would be insufficient for success. However, the elimination of stereotype threat apparently allowed women to view their resources as adequate to the task, producing physiological responses that typically assist in producing optimal performance. Men showed benefits when they believed their gender was favored on the test (consistent with \"stereotype lift\"), but showed responses consistent with threat when this supposed advantage was explicitly negated."

    "annotation": "This set of experiments address the impact of impression management motivation on coping with stereotype threat. It was hypothesized that individuals who are high in impression management (i.e., those individuals who chronically deny negative, but claim positive, self-attributes in a given context) would be most likely to deny stereotype threat either by denying that a stereotype is accurate (a collective strategy) or by denying that it is self-relevant (an individualistic strategy). In Experiment 1, male and female temporary workers (for whom there exists a negative stereotype), were exposed to a description of their group that stated in part either \"I find temporary employees under-skilled. Many don\u2019t have the necessary training to perform effectively and productively in their jobs, so we often have to train them\" (stereotype threat) or \"Temporary employees are quick to adjust to a new situation. They come in knowing they have a job to do and a short time to do it, so they have to be adaptable and fast learners. Most of them are very good at this\" (control). They then completed questionnaires containing a measure of self-doubted competency and and impression management scale. Impression management was correlated with denial of competency in the stereotype threat condition, but responses to these measures were unrelated in the control condition. In Experiment 2, older adults (ages 64-95, average age = 81) who were recruited based on their active involvement in the community or from hostels for the elderly completed measures of memory ability, self-reported memory failures, and impression management. Elder hostel residents showed worse memory and a stronger relationship between impression management and denial of cognitive failures than did than did those living in the community. In Experiment 3, African-American and White undergraduates were asked by a White or Black experimenter about their intelligence and athletic ability, then completed an impression management measure. Impression management correlated with self-reported intelligence for African-Americans but not for Whites. These effects were strongest when the experimenter was White and when the African-American had attended a predominantly Black high school, suggesting that the increase in denial by individuals high in impression management is audience specific and sensitive to familiarity with the audience. Experiment 4 extended this analysis into a context where individuals under stereotype threat actually had to perform in the domain in question. White students were instructed that they would perform an IQ test and were told either, \"You probably will not be surprised to hear that Asians tend to perform better than Whites on tests of intelligence. For this reason, we need you to indicate your ethnicity so that we can score people\u2019s performance separately by different racial groups\" (stereotype threat) or that \"the particular test used in this research was chosen because it was culturally fair\" (control). Before taking the test, students indicated their intelligence and their belief in its importance and completed a measure of impression management. Performance was marginally worse in the stereotype threat condition, but impression management was negatively related to the estimated importance of intelligence in the stereotype threat but not in the control condition. It appears that students high in impression management who actually had to perform the test did not indicate that they were intelligent and risk being embarrassed by poor performance. Instead, they distanced themselves from the domain by suggesting that their performance on a task under stereotype threat is unimportant. These studies indicate that when threatened by a stereotype, individuals who are concerned with impression management cope by denying incompetence in the threatened domain or the importance of the domain itself."

    "annotation": "Two studies examined whether test item content might play a role in stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, male and female students in grades 7-8 completed math story problems that were identical but used either male names, female names, or featured names not gender specific (control). Performance was significantly better when males names were used, but students with lower math scores were more likely to correctly answer items with female names. There were no significant effects due to students' gender. Experiment 2 used a similar method but focused on male and female college students and introduced a stereotype threat manipulation. Specifically, half the students were told that \"this test has been found to show gender differences in math performance. Overall, males have obtained higher scores than females on this test\" (stereotype threat for females) or \"we are simply interested in how well Canadian university students can solve these word problems\" (control). Men performed better than women, but only in the stereotype threat condition. Moreover, the effect did not occur for high-ability women, and there were minimal effects associated with gender-labeling of items. These data show that children, but not young adults, were affected by the gender-labeling of math problems. Young adults (specifically, young women), however, were affected by a manipulation of stereotype threat with lower math performance in conditions in which gender stereotypes were invoked."

    "annotation": "This paper reports a meta-analysis of studies on stereotype threat with a focus on the performance of groups who might be advantaged by an invoked stereotype (e.g., men in mathematics, African-Americans in athletics). The boosting of performance from an awareness that an outgroup is negatively stereotyped is called stereotype lift. The meta-analysis showed that stereotype lift produces improved performance in any context where the ability or worth of an outgroup is impugned, regardless of the means by which this is done. Only explicit refutations of stereotypes eliminated stereotype lift. Stereotype lift appears to results from making comparisons with a denigrated outgroup and lift is strongest for individuals who endorse outgroup stereotypes or the legitimacy of group-based hierarchies. Research on stereotype lift complements research on stereotype threat by providing additional evidence that group differences in task performance can arise when stereotypes are invoked alongside valued social identities."

    "annotation": "Two experiments examined how doubts about belonging, or belonging uncertainty, can arise under stereotype threat. Specifically, it was hypothesized that people who are stigmatized in a domain are less certain of the strength of their social bonds and more sensitive to information about social connections in that domain. In Experiment 1, Black and White undergraduates were asked to think of eight friends, two friends, or no friends who would fit well in a college computer science program. It was assumed that it would be more difficult for Black than for Whites to generate eight such friends, producing a greater threat to belonging in Blacks than Whites. After completing this task, students completed measures of their own perceived fit and potential in academics, the advice they would offer to another same-race student, and the accessibility of their racial stereotypes. Black students who generated eight friends reported a diminished sense of fit and lowered perceived potential, whereas White students were not affected by the manipulation. Moreover, Blacks in the eight-friends condition were less likely to advise a younger African-American to pursue computer science. Experiment 2 represented an intervention intended to encourage a sense of belonging by providing minority students with an alternate attribution to account for their typical lowered sense of belonging. Specifically, Black first-year students were encouraged to attribute feelings about not belonging in school to the struggles faced by all students during the transition to college rather than to their identity. Results indicated that the intervention reduced Blacks students' feelings of low belonging under conditions of adversity, increased Black students' estimates of their academic potential, increased academic behaviors (e.g., time spent studying) and academic performance (i.e., GPA in the subsequent semester). The intervention did not impact White students. These findings provide support for the idea that operating under stereotypes can reduce one's sense of belonging and show that an intervention involving altering attributions for these thoughts and feelings can buffer Black students from their negative consequences."

    "annotation": "These experiments conceptualize stereotype threat as a source of measurement bias in testing, allowing use of mathematical modeling to separate latent from measured variables. To allow this modeling in Experiment 1, White and minority Dutch high school students completed a multi-faceted test that was described either as pertaining to their interests and abilities (control) or, additionally, as an \"intelligence test\" (stereotype threat for minority students). In addition, students in the stereotype threat condition completed a form regarding their ethnicity before taking the exam, whereas students in the control condition did so after taking the exam. Modeling of the data showed that stereotype threat produced measurement bias in the minority group, and this bias arose in performance on the most difficult of the subtests. Experiment 2 involved a reanalysis of data from O'Brien and Crandall (2003), illustrating that stereotype threat for men and women in math could be successfully modeled. Experiment 3 involved a multi-faceted math test completed by male and female Dutch undergraduates with no mention of sex differences (control), the negation of sex differences (low stereotype threat), or the endorsement of sex differences in math (stereotype threat for women). Modeling identified that stereotype threat affected math test performance, and the strongest stereotype threat effects again emerged on the most difficult subtest. These studies provide a tool that may be useful for examining stereotype threat in both laboratory and real-world environments in which traditional statistical analyses might be problematic or even impossible to conduct."

    "annotation": "Two experiments were designed to distinguish different kinds of stereotype threat based on their source. Specifically, the study addressed whether stereotype threat that either focused on the group (group-threat) or on the performance of the individual group member (self-threat) might occur in different situations and be influenced by different factors. To test these possibilities, female undergraduates in Experiment 1 completed a difficult math test in one of four conditions: when the test was described as non-diagnostic of their ability (non-diagnostic control), when it was described as diagnostic of their abilities (traditional stereotype threat), when it was diagnostic but that they would grade their own test and results would be anonymous (self-threat), or when the test was diagnostic and would be used to assess average performance of men and women with little regard to their individual score (group-threat). Results showed that (after controlling for Math SAT scores) performance was worse in the traditional stereotype threat and the self-threat conditions compared with the control condition. Performance in the group-threat condition was also poorer than in the control condition, but not to a statistically significant degree. It was speculated that the weaker results in the group-threat condition might have occurred because only women who strongly identify with their gender might show performance decrements when their group identity was threatened. Experiment 2 assessed this possibility by having women complete the test in a non-diagnostic control, self-threat, or group-threat condition, but, prior to doing so, had them complete a measure of gender identification. Test performance was worse in the self-threat and group-threat conditions than in the control condition. Moreover, the strength of gender identification affected women's performance in the group-threat but not in the self-threat or control condition; women who most strongly identified with their gender performed most poorly in the group-threat condition. These findings suggest that stereotype threat can arise either because individuals are concerned about the applicability of a gender stereotype to themselves and to their group. Susceptibility to stereotype threat regarding one's group, however, appears to be moderated by the strength of one's identification with that group."

    "annotation": "This paper examines stereotype threat effects involved in driving ability. In Experiment 1, female university students with an average of several years experience completed a driving exercise on a simulator. Some women were told that the study was designed to assess \"mental processes involved in driving\" (control) whereas the other women were told that the study was to \"investigate the reasons that men are better drivers than women\" (stereotype threat). Although women in the two groups showed equivalent driving quality in terms of maintaining proper speed and road orientation, women in the stereotype threat condition were more than twice as likely to hit a pedestrian jaywalker who unexpectedly appeared near the end of the simulation (59% vs. 25%). Experiment 2 replicated the first study but added a concurrent demanding cognitive task for half of the participants. When participants were not asked to complete the demanding task while driving, results mirrored those obtained in Experiment 1; women in the stereotype threat condition were more than twice as likely to strike an unexpected pedestrian compared with women in the control condition. When drivers had to complete a concurrent cognitive task, however, performance in the control condition was negatively affected but was no worse in the stereotype threat condition. The fact that accidents were as likely in the control as in the stereotype threat condition under cognitive demand suggests that stereotype threat harms driving ability by reducing available cognitive capacity to react and adjust effectively to unexpected events."

    "annotation": "These experiments examined the effects of dual social identities and task framing on stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, college student-athletes described their latest academic success (student identity highlighted), their latest athletic competition (athlete identity highlighted), or provided directions from their dorm to the campus library (control), then completed measures of self-regard and a difficult math test. Students performed more poorly on the test when their identity as athletes had been highlighted compared with the other two conditions. However, academic self-esteem was lower in the athlete and control conditions compared with the condition in which student identity was highlighted. Lowered academic self-regard appeared to account for the lowered performance of the students whose athletic identity was highlighted. These findings show that highlighting one of several potential identities can influence task performance. They also suggest that in the absence of a highlighting of any one identity, the nature of the task itself can affect identity salience. Specifically, student-athletes in the control condition responded similarly on measures of academic self-regard as individuals led to think of their athletic identity, but they performed as well on the math test as individuals who were prompted to think of their student identity. Experiment 2 was designed to provide more direct evidence of heightened social identity in response to the task. Student-athletes completed either the self-regard measure or the math test from Experiment 1, then finished word fragments that allowed identification of the accessibility of their student vs. athlete identities. Individuals who completed the academic self-regard measure completed word fragments in a manner suggesting their athletic identity had been highlighted, whereas individuals who completed the math test showed evidence that their identity as students had been highlighted. These results show that for individuals with strong multiple identities, both the context and the task itself can influence identity salience and subsequent performance."

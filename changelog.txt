# Manual changes to separate text in blocks

Add the character "||" between citations in blocks that contain multiple citations.

First find out which blocks have multiple entries. Seems that ")." is a pretty consistent marker of a unique citation. Search for this in the 'text' field of each block and fitler on it.

block_counts = filter( lambda (i,b): b > 1, [ (i, block['text'].count(').')) for i,block in enumerate(blocks) ] )

Result is:

(30, 2) - not really
(31, 4) - only 2
(39, 2) 
(42, 7)
(48, 5)
(52, 3)
(56, 2) - not really
(59, 4)
(80, 2) - not really
(90, 2)
(118, 3)
(119, 2)
(120, 13)
(135, 2)
(144, 2)
(148, 2)
(150, 2)
(154, 2)
(158, 8)
(167, 2)
